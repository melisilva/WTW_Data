They’re funny and I like live action like ravens home but that’s a raven is better and I wish they had Annie she’s my favorite and that’s my favorite movie like ever they used to have it but they took it off and I was really sad so they should add it back and it is always kicking me out every day but I solve it by took five months to solve it and they should have more Netflix because Netflix is for 12+ and most people are under 12 like me pretty sure it is for 12 and plus because when I got it and most people like Disney+ less than they like Netflix because Netflix is more fun and they have more fun stuff. That’s why I’m giving this a two star because it’s not that but I love Disney watch and two look at all the new and interesting characters that they have or the old ones like Hannah Montana, Casey, and the cover, Jessie high school, musical and love the stuff live in Maddie like this piece this is me love Netflix JK love Disney+.😄❤️😍",4,False,Fun but not too fun,ftggggggggbf dgg grddrvgh

I restart my system restart the app and I put my email and password in and somehow it’s the wrong password???????? Like where did it go what do you mean wrong password?? I pay for the literal streaming service to make sure it has my password so I can watch the content no??? You’d think this multi billion dollar corporation could muster a few brain cells to learn how to put a password system on there app that doesn’t lose it every few weeks and refuses to acknowledge your account’s existence until it just randomly works one day just because. Oh and don’t worry if you try to put in your password more than once it kicks you out of the sign in screen and won’t let you put in your email and it suggest you press the “forgot password” button even though it literally kicked you out of the screen to press said “forgot password” button.

I also think the new  movies from Marvel should be immediately put on Disney Plus. You can have it in theaters, I have no problem with that, but the fact that I have to wait four to six months for a movie to come out on Disney Plus is ridiculous. I don’t like to go out to theaters, especially not with the increase in prices in every aspect of it. The food, drinks, gas for the car, and tickets. Also, if y’all put the movies on Disney Plus, you’d get more profit.

There’s no balance in social standards or consideration for subscribers. Here in NYC, we’ve lost programming with SPECTRUM, due to unscrupulous business wrangling from the Disney Corporation for more financial gain.

Especially when you realize that 98% of Disney’s catalog was made before the Disney+ streaming service was ever made, so you can’t say they’re trying to recoup production costs. The reason why this is such a bad thing is ads are terrible for children. There is years of research supporting this. I tried to watch Nad Batch with my son and 10% of the entire show was advertising. Do you want your children to have 10% of entertainment they see be advertising?

2023-09-30 09:03:08,"I am relatively new to Disney+, and I have become unexpectedly very pleased with the Mandalorian series. The production values are of high, cinematic, quality, and , Most of all, the Mandalorian tells stories that have a thread of morality and humanity in each episode. There is too little of this kind of material available today. Storytelling is an art. Too much content today fails to recognize this, preferring instead to rely on Computer generated effects, and truly meaningless action (accompanied by loud intrusive sound effects ). CGI addicts Rely on this, and therefore. They’re happy to settle for two dimensional characters, which differ very little from the background graphics.  The Mandalorian, on the other hand, produces a number of fully realized, three-dimensional characters which are capable of supporting well crafted plotting – even if some of them are generated by computer.

The inability to delete a show from continue watching is difficult on other apps, but they all have a way to do this. The complete lack of a way to do this just shows the Disney people really don’t understand how people stream at all. They think all their content is so good no one would ever not want to continue streaming any of their shows, which is patently ridiculous. So your continue watching list is just littered with things you don’t want to watch, half of which started automatically after you finished watching a show (yet another “feature” we have no way to disable!) So you miss when new episodes of the things you do want to watch come out! The app in general is just clunky and slow.

We can always filter out anything above PG or TV-14 etc.  but honestly these ratings have become ballpark indicators at best these days.  We all know certain R rated movies we might show our kids, and other PG-13 movies that we definitely don’t want them to see.  Heck I have my app limited to TV-14 and I STILL ran into a sex scene I was not ok with, and that was on a National Geographic show about space travel!  So why can’t we filter by those handy little abbreviations we see at the beginning?  You know, V - violence, SC - sexual content, etc.  Give users the power to actually filter the content.

2023-04-29 18:59:05,"The app works fine on its own, but when trying to connect to televisions (like my new Samsung) it has some struggles.

Casting used to work, but hasn’t worked for a solid year for me now. Deleting and redownloading, checking for updates, and making sure my phone is updated changes nothing. When I click the casting icon it tells me that casting is unavailable and gives me the option to “Allow” taking me to my settings, where everything is switched on. I’ve tried switching settings on and off, but no luck.

Since that doesn’t work, I try to AirPlay, but AirPlay usually just crashes after the few second long Disney logo that seems to play as a separate video before programs. The video plays on TV, then the whole app crashes. When, on rare occasion I can get past that—usually by starting a video on my phone, getting a little past the intro and then doing airplay—it will often just freeze up after 15 minutes or so.

There’s is a bug in your current version of the app for the AppleTV where once you play an HDR10 content show and then exit the playback and back to the app menu, the HDR10 setting doesn’t drop out and TV doesn’t revert back to non-HDR picture settings until you exit the app fully.

My favorite character is king because he’s just such a funny character and has a really cool arc to find out what he is (he was a titan all along(literally)). Luz throughout the entire show has to learn how to do magic to survive, and uses the magic of the boiling isles (kings dad(also known as the titan)). I really think they could have done a little more for season 3 though, as their are only 3 episodes.

Their newer material has taken a very sharp turn for the worst, with over the top “shove it down your throat” wokeism its hard to enjoy the same masterpieces that we did as kids. With many late box office flops, the originality has really went off the rails as well. Disney has turned to “live action features” with that same “woke” twist and has honestly ruined many great classic films. Not to mention the deteriorating MARVEL UNIVERSE, since Disneys buy out marvel has steadily went downhill. Its hard to watch a single movie just for a good hero story line, instead you get a pro lgbtq+ movie with a lot of CGI and some cool action sequences. Its just not what anyone would want or should have to expect from the studio that brought masterpieces like Lion King and Toy Story to the box office so many years ago… I hope they can turn it around and make less politically biased stuff and just make good stories again that support boys being strong, brave, chivalrous men and women being strong and nurturing leaders, mothers, and wives.",2,False,HERE FOR THE CLASSICS,Dilblev

Also, I don’t like the fact that no matter what I watch my top recommendations consist of only the most popular/newer shows.

I do not understand why we have to pay $14 in stead of $8 just to be able to download stuff. I do not care for the no ads but to pay almost double to get a feature that has always been available is really really really really disappointing. All of this raising prices and stopping stuff that has always been is just starting to get annoying. I’m about to delete my subscription because I honestly only let my daughter watch her iPad when we are traveling and I only got Disney because we were able to use it with out Wi-Fi by downloading all of the movies or shows she likes to keep her entertained but it makes no sense to pay double for something that isn’t having a daily use.

If you’re someone that likes to watch the end credit scenes after Marvel movies, good luck! The player automatically shrinks down to recommend the next movie before the end credit scene plays, and if you try to click on the player again to scale it back up, it crashes. You’ll have to reload the app over and over until it works, or until you give up and go somewhere else to watch it.

Most shows are very poor, which further reduces the appeal. All shows are either Star Wars or Marvel, so if you don’t have an interest in these, there is nothing worth watching.

2023-03-11 19:57:36,"Disney plus is by far the best streaming service in my personal opinion. However it does have just a couple things I’d like to mention for improvement! 

Now although this doesn’t happen often, I’ve noticed even after I’ve finished a show or movie it stays on my continue watching list. This can be quite frustrating however I’ve noticed it happening less recently so hopefully that means they’ve fixed the issue.

Next, this is without a doubt the most irritating and horrendous issue regarding Disney Plus… Ratatouille doesn’t have French audio or subtitles as an option! 
Besides these couple of little issues Disney plus is filled with entertaining content from all genres and for all ages. The coming soon section is very helpful to see new shows and movies, and it is very helpful to have the marvel studio in chronological order for once.

However, this is not the case with Disney+ MENA, which obligates you to make an apple ID from the same country if it’s to be streamed on Apple TV.

The MENA version only offers signing up by phone number, which means you can only watch it on any other TV streaming device, except for Apple TV’s version as it requires a new apple ID from the same country, in my case, Saudi Arabia.
