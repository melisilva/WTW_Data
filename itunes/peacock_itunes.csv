2023-12-19 03:44:11,I have had your app for only a few moments and have yet to fully understand all its capabilities‚Äî I think you all need to program your review pop up for later timeframe so that the user of the app is able to get full use of it. I do appreciate getting control of my TV back as my Remote just stopped working out of no where and I changed batteries to brand new ‚Äî so I do appreciate that the app is giving me access to the TV again ‚Äî tho I do need more time to see how the app is working in its entirety. Thank you and Happy Holidays!,4,False,caraden lynn,Asking for a review too soon
2023-09-16 12:16:16,The whole purpose of getting this was because my bf keeps losing the remotes and to have a back up sometimes. Well you have to ask and accept permission from the tv every single time you turn it on or even if it‚Äôs just been a few hours. Needing a remote. I was gonna give it 5 stars because functionality and design is great but with this it‚Äôs practically useless. We‚Äôre missing one remote rn and If I want to use this one I literally have to pick up the remote and use it so what‚Äôs the point in switching to the phone. And the back and forth is so annoying. I would be less harsh with my rating cos the app itself is great but this sure wasn‚Äôt worth $40. Could‚Äôve and should‚Äôve bought another remote.,2,False,hsofiekksx,Need to reconnect after every use
