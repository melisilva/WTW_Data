2023-03-09 09:36:23,"As another commenter noted a couple of days ago, AirPlay has stopped working properly since last update. Overall this is the app I use most to watch TV/movies because of preferring the interface and really enjoying the X-ray feature of trivia and cast info when available. However, overnight, I stopped being able to stream my audio through to my wifi external speakers via AirPlay. Or rather, i can do so but without seeing the video. I am able to through my one speaker using it in Bluetooth mode but otherwise i get a black screen and sound. Or I can watch the video with just the regular iPad sound, but I prefer the better and louder quality of my Sonos system and I often stream it through my house as I’m moving room to room. Oddly, I can have the full AirPlay sound AND video if I minimize the video to use screen-in-screen but it won’t go back to the full screen with audio AND video when I remaximize it. PLEASE FIX ASAP. This is beyond frustrating and I was about to factory reset my iPad because I thought my machine was the problem until I played with every other app repeatedly and then saw that other review describing the same problem.",2,False,AirPlay issues,Kstarr81
2024-01-21 17:39:41,"The worst company and the worst streaming app I’ve ever experienced. If I could give it negative stars I would. They very clearly have bots leaving positive reviews to adjust their rating because the internet is filled with others saying the same thing i am. 

The entire purpose of this app now is to force you into buying a dozen channels just to be able to watch any of the content. The UI is the worst of all the apps. None of the content I’ve purchased shows up as being mine when I search for it. Countless times it has tried to get me to purchase a movie or a season I ALREADY OWN. On top of that, if you search for a show/movie it will often make it seem as though it’s free until you start watching. Then that literal same video and any sequels (that were also listed as free) will suddenly cost money to watch. 

I’ve tried filing complaints, giving feedback, expressing concerns with customer service. Avoid this app like the plague, you’ll sign over the rights to every bit of privacy you have and in return you’ll be scammed out of your money and ignored by the company when you try to correct issues.",1,False,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,bookdoctor8890

Finding the shows the are included in my subscription or currently watched are too hard to find, however the same shows for purchase comes up first even when they are included in my subscription. This is a rip off. Why should the app charge you for shows that are included in your subscription? Why pay for the channel and this (plus others) that are included just to purchase what’s supposed to be included? Maybe this is a change but it’s too much work to look for what I’m already paying for. Also huge con that they don’t offer Peacock but I’m sure if I purchased their channel, it would be the same thing. Considering canceling as other streaming options can bundle more channels for a better price by the time you add all the subscriptions and don’t even get what’s offered without paying additional on top of the channel.

I’m not deaf or hard of hearing or anything however having the subtitles on really helps me understand what’s going on. It is really annoying to have to turn on the subtitles every-time i leave the app, or whenever a new episode starts (sometimes it works most of the time they turn off) I would really appreciate if there was just a setting to have the subtitles stay in for everything they’re available for. other than that the originals are great and the video quality is as-well, if you are also someone who relies on subtitles keep in mind that they can be very annoying at times.",4,False,subtitles are very finicky,Hufflepuff11201

When it DOES manage to load I try and watch something it continues loading then a message pops up saying there’s a problem with the app and it prompts me to close the app. When I use it on my LG TV OS it works perfectly fine which is a nice change.

2023-08-16 19:50:21,"It’s amazing to me how the last few updates have transformed this from being a really solid five star app to deserving less than one star. I gave it two out of loyalty. 

In the past, you could see the upcoming episodes under the one you were watching, like every other video streaming app. They changed that.

In the past, the auto rotate kicked in at a much more intuitive point. They made that a lot worse as well, replacing it with a button.

In the past, when you were watching a series, the app saved your progress, but now it only does so every so often. 

In the past, if you were watching an episode of a series and closed the app, when you re-opened that episode, it would start back up where you left off. Now it starts from the beginning. 

Many basic functions any video streaming app should have have been kneecap or removed in recent months. 

Honestly, it’s like a concerted effort to try to destroy the app. It was one of the best video streaming apps before, but now has become as enjoyable to use as scooping out your own eyeballs with a scalding nail. 

I don’t know if this is something that the developers are doing to look busy and save their jobs but please stop. Sitting on their hands and doing nothing would’ve been much more preferable. Roll it back a few versions and stay there.",2,False,Stop making the app worse!,Finnels91

2023-03-25 22:06:30,"After years of working like a charm, recently this app went haywire. It refuses to recognize that I've watched a movie or tv show, even when I go all the way to the end, and that show or movie REMAINS IN MY ""CONTINUE WATCHING"" LIST, ad infinitum. That list is now overloaded with shows I can't get rid of. (There has to be some function they dan add to allow you to REMOVE something from """"Continue Watching???"" Also, it's taking forever to get the latest episodes on tv shows. On some shows I have on my watch list, it's been almost three weeks, and I haven't gotten the next episode yet.

2023-10-02 20:19:52,"The playback experience isn’t great. And since this is a movie app, I feel like that should be a big deal. 

There’s no reason the movie / show should stop playing anytime I exit the app. Having to restart the show every single time I go to send a text or check my email is super annoying. 

When pressing play, why does it default to portrait viewing instead of landscape…especially when my phone is already in landscape. The little “rotate screen” button isn’t useful because only rotates to landscape on one side. If your phone happens to be tilted to the other side, tapping the button to switch it to landscape turns the screen upside down. The only way to fix it is turn the phone upright again, wait for the app to register that the angle of the phone has changed, and then tilt it to the side again. 
NO ONE cares about XRay enough for it to be the default view. 

The only truly helpful and innovative feature is the swipe left or right to skip or go back 10 seconds. It’d also be great to have a slider for brightness in the app. Although I’m sure that’s not going to be considered since you wouldn’t want playback to be as convenient as it is on Netflix.",2,False,Needs basic functions added,Mattmyersmusic
