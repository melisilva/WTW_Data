The commercials have gotten so excessive and I know you can pay to avoid that but being a single minimum wage worker, it’s not possible and if I’m paying $10 a month (i could be wrong but I’m pretty sure got higher than it was in the past) I’d like to not have a random shaving commercial blasting on my screen every 15 minutes during a movie. Now there’s even an ad when you pause, it’s a little ridiculous. It’s become the equivalent of just getting a cable box and hoping something good is gonna play between the commercials. Even when I try to watch on my PlayStation I have issues with connection or loading errors.

My biggest issue with this new update is that the app won’t play anything at all now. It keeps telling me to download the latest update and I have obviously but it either doesn’t register that I did or the app just isn’t being programmed correctly and I can’t even use the $10/month app now.

The selection of shows and movies are awesome, the constant issues that seem to be consistent no matter how many updates is a waste of my time and money and if the app was put together a little better it might be worth it to keep my subscription.",2,False,App won’t work at all now,Ally__e

Lots of other bad interface choices. For example, tapping the middle of the screen while watching brings up the controls, so you have to tap again to pause.

Ok I’m nine so my parents have my profile set to PG and lots of times when I go on it to watch my fav movie Matilda and I can’t find it I’m like “nbd I can just search it up” so I go to do that and I CANT FIND IT.

2023-01-16 15:50:27,,I wanted to change my password so I opened the HBO Max website. But when I selected sign in it kept opening a page for me to download the app! What happened to being able to sign in on the site? Companies are getting more and more ridiculous and less and less customer friendly every day!,3,False,Can’t sign in online!

It works best on a computer but you are lucky if it gets through a half hour without freezing up or stopping altogether or glitching during the most important part of a movie. Really ruins the entire experience to have to start and stop or have to worry about the whole thing quitting on you if you risk pressing pause. Terrible experience.,2,False,HboMax as a service only works half the time,Guitarplayer >4yrs

HBO max offers great titles and amazing documentaries but being able to get there or even play them is a 5min ordeal. I have 1gbs home Wi-Fi and still am unable to get the piece of slow garbage to keep up.

There are general issues with the app (sometimes glitchy, auto play would cut off episodes of Hacks like 5 minutes before the episodes ended), but the biggest problem is with the availability of subtitles for shows. A show will have subtitles, we will pause it or recast it, and then there are no subtitles available anymore. It makes watching content from the app difficult for a HoH person.",1,False,Subtitles suddenly disappear / problems with Chromecast,glossbird
