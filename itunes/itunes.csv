Overall this is the app I use most to watch TV/movies because of preferring the interface and really enjoying the X-ray feature of trivia and cast info when available. However, overnight, I stopped being able to stream my audio through to my wifi external speakers via AirPlay. Or rather, i can do so but without seeing the video. I am able to through my one speaker using it in Bluetooth mode but otherwise i get a black screen and sound. Or I can watch the video with just the regular iPad sound, but I prefer the better and louder quality of my Sonos system and I often stream it through my house as I’m moving room to room. Oddly, I can have the full AirPlay sound AND video if I minimize the video to use screen-in-screen but it won’t go back to the full screen with audio AND video when I remaximize it. PLEASE FIX ASAP. This is beyond frustrating and I was about to factory reset my iPad because I thought my machine was the problem until I played with every other app repeatedly and then saw that other review describing the same problem.",2,False,AirPlay issues,Kstarr81
2024-01-21 17:39:41,"The worst company and the worst streaming app I’ve ever experienced. If I could give it negative stars I would. They very clearly have bots leaving positive reviews to adjust their rating because the internet is filled with others saying the same thing i am. 

The entire purpose of this app now is to force you into buying a dozen channels just to be able to watch any of the content. The UI is the worst of all the apps. None of the content I’ve purchased shows up as being mine when I search for it. Countless times it has tried to get me to purchase a movie or a season I ALREADY OWN. On top of that, if you search for a show/movie it will often make it seem as though it’s free until you start watching. Then that literal same video and any sequels (that were also listed as free) will suddenly cost money to watch. 

I’ve tried filing complaints, giving feedback, expressing concerns with customer service.

Finding the shows the are included in my subscription or currently watched are too hard to find, however the same shows for purchase comes up first even when they are included in my subscription. This is a rip off. Why should the app charge you for shows that are included in your subscription? Why pay for the channel and this (plus others) that are included just to purchase what’s supposed to be included? Maybe this is a change but it’s too much work to look for what I’m already paying for. Also huge con that they don’t offer Peacock but I’m sure if I purchased their channel, it would be the same thing. Considering canceling as other streaming options can bundle more channels for a better price by the time you add all the subscriptions and don’t even get what’s offered without paying additional on top of the channel.

I’m not deaf or hard of hearing or anything however having the subtitles on really helps me understand what’s going on. It is really annoying to have to turn on the subtitles every-time i leave the app, or whenever a new episode starts (sometimes it works most of the time they turn off) I would really appreciate if there was just a setting to have the subtitles stay in for everything they’re available for. other than that the originals are great and the video quality is as-well, if you are also someone who relies on subtitles keep in mind that they can be very annoying at times.",4,False,subtitles are very finicky,Hufflepuff11201

When it DOES manage to load I try and watch something it continues loading then a message pops up saying there’s a problem with the app and it prompts me to close the app. When I use it on my LG TV OS it works perfectly fine which is a nice change. Although when I use my Apple TV 4K 3rd Gen. it does the SAME thing my Vizio TV does!

2023-08-16 19:50:21,"It’s amazing to me how the last few updates have transformed this from being a really solid five star app to deserving less than one star. I gave it two out of loyalty. 

In the past, you could see the upcoming episodes under the one you were watching, like every other video streaming app. They changed that.

In the past, the auto rotate kicked in at a much more intuitive point. They made that a lot worse as well, replacing it with a button.

In the past, when you were watching a series, the app saved your progress, but now it only does so every so often. 

In the past, if you were watching an episode of a series and closed the app, when you re-opened that episode, it would start back up where you left off. Now it starts from the beginning. 

Many basic functions any video streaming app should have have been kneecap or removed in recent months. 

Honestly, it’s like a concerted effort to try to destroy the app. It was one of the best video streaming apps before, but now has become as enjoyable to use as scooping out your own eyeballs with a scalding nail.

It refuses to recognize that I've watched a movie or tv show, even when I go all the way to the end, and that show or movie REMAINS IN MY ""CONTINUE WATCHING"" LIST, ad infinitum. That list is now overloaded with shows I can't get rid of. (There has to be some function they dan add to allow you to REMOVE something from """"Continue Watching???"" Also, it's taking forever to get the latest episodes on tv shows. On some shows I have on my watch list, it's been almost three weeks, and I haven't gotten the next episode yet. So, as of now, this app is a real mess and I have no idea why, all of a sudden, it got to be this way.

2023-10-02 20:19:52,"The playback experience isn’t great. And since this is a movie app, I feel like that should be a big deal. 

There’s no reason the movie / show should stop playing anytime I exit the app. Having to restart the show every single time I go to send a text or check my email is super annoying. 

When pressing play, why does it default to portrait viewing instead of landscape…especially when my phone is already in landscape. The little “rotate screen” button isn’t useful because only rotates to landscape on one side. If your phone happens to be tilted to the other side, tapping the button to switch it to landscape turns the screen upside down. The only way to fix it is turn the phone upright again, wait for the app to register that the angle of the phone has changed, and then tilt it to the side again. 
NO ONE cares about XRay enough for it to be the default view. 

The only truly helpful and innovative feature is the swipe left or right to skip or go back 10 seconds.

Subtitle translations range from awkward to flat-out wrong (eg 5 thousand vs 5 million).  But the Premium service in particular is a scam. The main benefit seems to be downloading episodes to watch later. However, the downloaded content feature is so buggy that I regret paying anything for it. One time on a plane the app logged me out of my account and I couldn’t log back in (that was a long 5 hours). Another time all the content I had downloaded inexplicably disappeared. (Tech support says they’re working on it, but I haven’t heard of any progress for a week now.) Sometimes trying to play downloaded content simply crashes the app. This all happened within a week of me signing up for the service, so I’m sure there are more bugs that I just haven’t experienced yet. In addition, learning mode simply does not work without an internet connection, even when viewing downloaded content. This does not appear to be a bug, but appears to be by design, and tech support told me that it is not a priority for them to fix right now. I thought learning mode was one of the selling points of this service, but since it requires an internet connection to use anyways, I recommend getting the language reactor extension to chrome and using any other streaming service if possible. If the content you are looking for can only be found on Viki, whatever you do, sign up for the cheapest monthly plan possible and cancel it once you’ve seen what you want. I made the mistake of purchasing a year membership in advance, thinking I would use this service enough for it to be worth it. Then when I foolishly attempted to upgrade to a premium membership in order to download content for some travel, I was forced to either purchase and annual premium membership or wait until my annual basic membership had expired. Now I’m short $125 with only buggy, poorly translated streaming service to pay for it. Of course, Viki says that none of this justifies a refund. Save yourself. Don’t do what I did. If you must use Viki to watch your favorite show, pay the minimum amount then cancel your subscription immediately.",1,False,wompus midway,READ THIS before paying for PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP

This happened last January but I couldn’t prove it so I just let it go. This year it happened again and this time I had proof. So what did they do? They cancelled my subscription. How did they cheat me? Well on January 6th they charged my accounts its monthly fee, I had no problem with that because that’s what I signed up for after all. 
———————————————————————————————————Then on January 28th they charged me again. I thought they were doing the February bill early but I was still uneasy so I wrote apple to watch out and please make sure they don’t charge me again un February since I had paid already on January 28th. I made sure that I still had my receipts stating that the transactions had gone through. But lo and behold on February 5th I was charged again. I immediately found my receipts and sent everything to apple. They decided in my favor, (although the refund has yet to be sent back to my account). Next thing know my subscription was cancelled and when I say cancelled I mean immediately everything was shut down. You know how they usually give you the last month? Not so they didn’t even give me that.—————————————————————————————————————- So here I am with over $30 spent for a one month subscription period. I sent the evidence to Viki as well but still nothing. So like I said, although some their movies are great I can only give one star because they’re trying to cheat me. If you want to charge me twice in the first month of the year I MIGHT have agreed to it if you sent a notice or something stating that this would happen, but the fact that you trying to sneak and do it is what gets me. You didn’t tell me you just did it. —————————————————————————————————————-Last but not least, If this is a computer glitch then I most humbly apologize because obviously it wasn’t done on purpose, I truly do because my computer be acting whack sometimes too. But you need to get your IT department to fix it because I don’t like being cheated, no one does.",1,False,Concerned-one,Only one star

The problem is that the “customer support” will acknowledge that the problem is being looked into and then, CLOSE the ticket!  

As if, they actually solved the problem!  By closing the ticket, they ignore you and dismiss the problem, sweep it under the rug and prevent other subscribers facing the same problem from voicing their similar concerns or opinions.  

I am a paid subscriber and have had the same issue for almost a year.  Once a month, I will open a case. Within a day, they will close the case but never resolve the issue.  They cut off all communication with me, the original poster.  They straight up GHOST you.

Once they forgot to close one of my cases immediately and several other users were able to comment on my issue and I could see that this was frustrating other subscribers worldwide.  They immediately “closed” the case with no resolution.  

If you go to their zendesk support page, you will see thousands of examples where subscribers open a case to point out a problem they are encountering only for the Viki “support” team to swiftly close the case, with no resolution, no conversation with the subscriber… just an automated response that essentially says, “We have received your message.  Your case is closed.  We are cutting off further communication.”

In short, if there’s any glitch or issue, please know that they will not even waste a single second to make anything right.  You will have to tolerate it until you reach a point, like I have, where you simply give up, wait for your subscription to run its course and eventually, unsubscribe.",1,False,JimD101,Customer Service GHOSTS You

Some of the ones I loved even disappeared like Strong Woman Do Bong-Soon for example. But since using this app and browsing it, I’ve found all sorts of familiar faces, series I had heard of but never found, or series I missed.
I find it very easy to navigate, especially the buttons for the different region dramas. 
The descriptions are good and I love how it lists the actors and then gives you information about them.
I especially love, and this is what actually made me write this review, the subtitle teams. They all have names specific to their dramas and they’re so fun and they do a good job. I love how they will explain in the subtitles what cultural significance and definitions of things are.

You can also watch shows while they’re on air as well. The English subtitles are great, nicely translated and not to fast.

A good selection of new releases and classic movies and tv shows from several Asian countries.

Search feature works pretty well: you can filter by country as well as by genre. You can search by a show’s title, actor’s name or director’s name, but searching by a person’s name will only bring up their IMDB profile. Adding links to an actor or director’s available movies when you search their name would be a helpful addition.

Customer reviews are easy to write and edit. You have option of a numerical rating only (1 to 10 stars) or writing a full review. Reviews with spoiler alerts are marked with an asterisk. They also have a separate “conversation” section where customers can chat about shows they are watching online.

Unfortunately, reviews are not translated, and since I only speak English, I don’t have access to reviews written in other languages. It would be nice if they would add a translator app, as Amazon does for their customer reviews.

Other things I would change or add: 1) add the name of the character under the actor’s picture in the “about” section, as the IMDB picture doesn’t always match their appearance in the movie or tv show; 2) make it possible to search the actors in a scene/cast while watching the movie or tv show (similar to the X-Ray feature on Amazon Prime); 3) move the trailers up to a more prominent place (you currently have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page on the “about” section. I didn’t discover the trailers until months after I started using the Vicki app); 4) add a customer feedback link to allow customers to make suggestions on improving the app or requesting to add specific shows/movies.",4,False,Vicki Customer,"Good, but could be great"
