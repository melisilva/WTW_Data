2023-07-12 18:18:55,"I love gas digital and everything they do, this app does just need a little work. It constantly kicks me from what I’m watching to main menu. It makes it difficult to navigate other apps while listening to a podcast. And it really should hold your spot when your in the middle of a show have to do something else and come back to hit play only to have it start you from the beginning",3,False,ErrlWaxxington,Love Gas
2023-08-27 03:03:17,"This is definitely better then logging in to the website every time but the user interface is off and every time I’m watching the video version of a podcast the loading wheel is constantly spinning in the middle of the screen. The ui could use improvement finding shows other then los, rap, and part of the problem is a hassle. The only way I’ve found to get rid of the loading wheel is to hit the -10sec button but it’s not reliable and the +30sec button isn’t either. It doesn’t make sense to have those as different denominations either have it as -30 +30 or -10 +10. Another small complaint is that the buttons on the screen are too small if I try to pause or rewind I hit the time bar instead and rewind way too far back or fast forward way too far. Some people pay like $15 a month for this y’all should step it up.",2,False,theguy445,Needs improvement
2023-06-29 14:56:59,"Updated review:
Was able to login, and have had 0 issues with the app.
Newer listener so I’ve seen the issues stated with multiple platforms but in my experience I have had very minimal complication with the app, and the websites they have used this past year. Really enjoy being able to watch back through the years.",5,False,RoRo4200,Love the all
2023-09-01 19:10:24,"If luis’ band of monkeys don’t add a “recently played” feature, or fix the issue where if you close out of the app and reopen it the podcast stops and brings you to the Home Screen, I am literally going to hang myself and write a note blaming the entire gAs team. Also a video quality selector would be sweet. It’s on the website so why in the motherhuck is it not on the app. LUIS. GET THESE ISSUES FIXED",4,False,Prince of destruction,My thoughts
2023-06-19 19:16:59,"Excited to see the network get an app. It’s still in it’s early stages though.

2023-07-20 21:46:58,"I love so many Gas Digital podcasts, but their tech is consistently underwhelming.  No Picture in Picture, shows don’t show up on the iPhone player when my phone is locked, the app closes my show if I’m not in the app for more than 5 minutes, and most show archives only go back a couple months.

2023-09-08 11:16:21,"The app needs a lot of work, especially in terms of contacting any sort of support. The app constantly kicks me off of whatever I’m watching/listening to and the RSS link never works in Apple Podcasts. If Luis would hire a reputable developer instead of constantly taking *insert random woman’s name here* to *insert exotic foreign country here*, the app would be better than any other subscription service.",1,False,BlackLabelBrad,"Love the network, hate the app"

2023-06-29 12:26:46,The app resets anytime I use another app or let my phone go to Lock Screen. There is no Picture in Picture or anyway to prevent this as far as I can tell.

2024-01-29 02:02:32,"This app is absolutely TERRIBLE on the iPhone (not sure about an Android phone). It is almost unusable. It crashes (app refreshes) constantly when you have paused an episode. Then when you go to app again, you have to find the episode that you were watching, which can be a pain if you are watching an older show. Wireless (and presumably, wired) headphone controls do not work properly. Yes, the PAUSE button works, but if the app is not currently active on your screen then the PLAY button will not work and the app will crash (refresh). 
*** I've found (I think) a work-around that fixes the issue most of the time (it will still crash sometimes). When you need to pause your show; open your phone, go to the app and pause manually. NEVER use the pause button on your headphones, it will crash 100% of the time. Skipping 30-seconds or rewinding from your headphones does NOT work. Luis, please fix this. I love GAS Digital but I would rather use a podcast app then the GAS app most of the time.",1,False,Kyle L. Christmas,TERRIBLE on an iPhone

2023-08-22 12:20:58,"Main issues I have are when pausing the app will lose its place in the episode of whatever you’re watching/listening to and have to scroll back through to find your spot. And on top of that the controls for the players are so small and close together that trying to rewind you’ll end up hitting pause or worse accidentally touching the bar that will shift you back to the beginning of the episode. It’s infuriating, would rather listen/watch on YouTube but i like having the uncensored content and getting it earlier than free release. Please fix, the media player is downright awful.",2,False,Nicknamesaregayer,Media Player on the App is Terrible
2023-08-02 15:57:45,"App doesn’t save your place in a video when you pause the videos and use another app, without closing gas digital app, so when you go back to the gas app you have to search for the video you were just watching/listening to, and then try to find wherever you were watching from before.

2023-06-27 04:56:18,"I'm pretty sure most people would just prefer the podcasts work on as many podcasting apps as possible. Be able to get a link to a private YouTube feed in the app. And maybe support apple podcast subscriptions (even if at a markup to cover the Apple Tax). 

The app is fine for what it is. Just feels weird considering other shows work in nearly every app.",2,False,MonsterRayn,Not sure why an app is necessary.
