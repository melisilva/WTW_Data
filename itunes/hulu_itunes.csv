The main problem I am running into is the ads. I don’t mind them when they actually play all the way through. But there are certain ones that just refuse to play and then I am sitting and waiting for a 23 second ad that takes 10 minutes to play. It is frustrating, but we understand that you have to get revenue to keep the service free for those who cannot pay for the subscription. But if you could fix the ads from freezing that would be great. The show is 53 minutes long but it takes two hours to watch because a ad freezes up. And it’s not my internet. Update I just uninstalled the app probably for good they just updated it but now when you are watching a show either the ads freeze or the whole thing freezes and then the app shuts down. What was a great app is now so bad that unless you can afford the subscription is not worth having three hours of trying to watch one episode, and it is not my internet because I watch other streaming apps without any of the issues that I am experiencing with this app. I usually don’t leave a review but it’s gotten so bad since the update that I will probably not reinstall.

It is my #1 entertainment App that is portable as is available to go on my cell phone & tablet.  I would, however, consider the idea of double checking the English translations for accuracy and better dialogue flow if Viki would contact me.  These shows have opened my eyes to Asian cultures and customs that previously I knew little about especially: honorifics, formally confessing Love that seems so widespread with Asians, eating well and sleeping well, soju and wedding and funeral venues.  The stunning outer beauty of Asian peoples as well as the inner beauty can be most compelling!  It would seem people around the world are the same and we all want to enjoy the good things in life despite hardships and tribulations that sometimes we must endure.  I for one enjoy a great story that is not laced with unnecessary and distracting profanity, sex and extreme violence.  Viki has provided programming that doesn’t force me to clench my teeth!

On rare occasions one may find the comments intrusive and they often contain spoilers. But it’s easy to disable comments when watching a movie or show if you want to.

 1. There should be  built in to each show an opportunity to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.
 2. Maybe a category to WATCH AGAIN.
3. Listen and respond to subscribers on anticipated shows not currently shown in region and make real attempts to release those programs.
4. STOP deleting huge blocks of episodes of variety shows.  You can always break them down by seasons or year (s).
5. Make attempt to bring to screen majority if not all works done by major artists.  From early works to present. (If possible)

Subtitle translations range from awkward to flat-out wrong (eg 5 thousand vs 5 million).  But the Premium service in particular is a scam. The main benefit seems to be downloading episodes to watch later. However, the downloaded content feature is so buggy that I regret paying anything for it. One time on a plane the app logged me out of my account and I couldn’t log back in (that was a long 5 hours). Another time all the content I had downloaded inexplicably disappeared. (Tech support says they’re working on it, but I haven’t heard of any progress for a week now.) Sometimes trying to play downloaded content simply crashes the app. This all happened within a week of me signing up for the service, so I’m sure there are more bugs that I just haven’t experienced yet. In addition, learning mode simply does not work without an internet connection, even when viewing downloaded content. This does not appear to be a bug, but appears to be by design, and tech support told me that it is not a priority for them to fix right now. I thought learning mode was one of the selling points of this service, but since it requires an internet connection to use anyways, I recommend getting the language reactor extension to chrome and using any other streaming service if possible. If the content you are looking for can only be found on Viki, whatever you do, sign up for the cheapest monthly plan possible and cancel it once you’ve seen what you want. I made the mistake of purchasing a year membership in advance, thinking I would use this service enough for it to be worth it. Then when I foolishly attempted to upgrade to a premium membership in order to download content for some travel, I was forced to either purchase and annual premium membership or wait until my annual basic membership had expired. Now I’m short $125 with only buggy, poorly translated streaming service to pay for it. Of course, Viki says that none of this justifies a refund. Save yourself. Don’t do what I did. If you must use Viki to watch your favorite show, pay the minimum amount then cancel your subscription immediately.",1,False,wompus midway,READ THIS before paying for PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP

This happened last January but I couldn’t prove it so I just let it go. This year it happened again and this time I had proof. So what did they do? They cancelled my subscription. How did they cheat me? Well on January 6th they charged my accounts its monthly fee, I had no problem with that because that’s what I signed up for after all. 
———————————————————————————————————Then on January 28th they charged me again. I thought they were doing the February bill early but I was still uneasy so I wrote apple to watch out and please make sure they don’t charge me again un February since I had paid already on January 28th. I made sure that I still had my receipts stating that the transactions had gone through. But lo and behold on February 5th I was charged again. I immediately found my receipts and sent everything to apple. They decided in my favor, (although the refund has yet to be sent back to my account). Next thing know my subscription was cancelled and when I say cancelled I mean immediately everything was shut down. You know how they usually give you the last month? Not so they didn’t even give me that.—————————————————————————————————————- So here I am with over $30 spent for a one month subscription period. I sent the evidence to Viki as well but still nothing. So like I said, although some their movies are great I can only give one star because they’re trying to cheat me. If you want to charge me twice in the first month of the year I MIGHT have agreed to it if you sent a notice or something stating that this would happen, but the fact that you trying to sneak and do it is what gets me. You didn’t tell me you just did it. —————————————————————————————————————-Last but not least, If this is a computer glitch then I most humbly apologize because obviously it wasn’t done on purpose, I truly do because my computer be acting whack sometimes too.

The problem is that the “customer support” will acknowledge that the problem is being looked into and then, CLOSE the ticket!  

As if, they actually solved the problem!  By closing the ticket, they ignore you and dismiss the problem, sweep it under the rug and prevent other subscribers facing the same problem from voicing their similar concerns or opinions.  

I am a paid subscriber and have had the same issue for almost a year.  Once a month, I will open a case. Within a day, they will close the case but never resolve the issue.  They cut off all communication with me, the original poster.  They straight up GHOST you.

Once they forgot to close one of my cases immediately and several other users were able to comment on my issue and I could see that this was frustrating other subscribers worldwide.  They immediately “closed” the case with no resolution.  

If you go to their zendesk support page, you will see thousands of examples where subscribers open a case to point out a problem they are encountering only for the Viki “support” team to swiftly close the case, with no resolution, no conversation with the subscriber… just an automated response that essentially says, “We have received your message.  Your case is closed.  We are cutting off further communication.”

In short, if there’s any glitch or issue, please know that they will not even waste a single second to make anything right.  You will have to tolerate it until you reach a point, like I have, where you simply give up, wait for your subscription to run its course and eventually, unsubscribe.",1,False,JimD101,Customer Service GHOSTS You

They all have quite a few but rarely could I find two with the same actor, or they would all be very old ones, or all would be completely different genres. Some of the ones I loved even disappeared like Strong Woman Do Bong-Soon for example. But since using this app and browsing it, I’ve found all sorts of familiar faces, series I had heard of but never found, or series I missed.
I find it very easy to navigate, especially the buttons for the different region dramas. 
The descriptions are good and I love how it lists the actors and then gives you information about them.
I especially love, and this is what actually made me write this review, the subtitle teams. They all have names specific to their dramas and they’re so fun and they do a good job. I love how they will explain in the subtitles what cultural significance and definitions of things are.
Im glad I finally was able to take some time and start using this one.",5,False,S0rin09,I really like this app

Has such a great collection of dramas, I’ve watched 90% of my personal list on this app. I do want to say that there could definitely be improvements made to the app! Having the timed comments button hidden in the menu options on mobile devices really hinders the experience for me since I like to toggle it on/off at various times. I’d like to see it have it’s own spot on the main screen. Maybe this is just me being picky, but I also notice a slight lag when pressing on the screen to pause or do whatever else on the screen. It’s not as fluid as other apps like YouTube in my opinion, not the end of the world, though. I hope this app can continue to grow more in the future!!",5,False,zuzu0431,Would love some improvements to the UI

First is I LOVE this app. It’s free to sign up and even if you don’t have viki pass (standard or premium) you still have access to a lot of shows and movies. You can also watch shows while they’re on air as well. The English subtitles are great, nicely translated and not to fast. Btw the subtitle teams work really fast so you don’t have to wait too long for an episode in %100 English to come out.
I also like how you can find collections and how there shows from all over Asia, Japan, Thailand, Korea, China. However lately l have been getting issues with the ads. Whenever an ad comes up or will freeze and the only way to get out of it is to click learn more and go back into the app. Even then it only plays for like 2 seconds or none at all. It’s just really annoying and slows down the experience. I also don’t like how you can’t change your username or profile in general. This is just a preference bc I like to customize things. Overall it’s a great app to watch lots of free shows and movies. Thank, have fun binging <3",4,False,audi1922,Good but a few minor problems

It felt like it took more time to find new or exciting dramas that I liked when I was searching for them on my own. Also, I enjoy having many options to choose from as far as C and K dramas. There are new (to me) dramas that are not even on Netflix. I would definitely recommend this service to friends.",5,False,LR149,Rave reviews!!!

A good selection of new releases and classic movies and tv shows from several Asian countries.

Search feature works pretty well: you can filter by country as well as by genre. You can search by a show’s title, actor’s name or director’s name, but searching by a person’s name will only bring up their IMDB profile. Adding links to an actor or director’s available movies when you search their name would be a helpful addition.

Customer reviews are easy to write and edit. You have option of a numerical rating only (1 to 10 stars) or writing a full review. Reviews with spoiler alerts are marked with an asterisk. They also have a separate “conversation” section where customers can chat about shows they are watching online.

Unfortunately, reviews are not translated, and since I only speak English, I don’t have access to reviews written in other languages. It would be nice if they would add a translator app, as Amazon does for their customer reviews.

Other things I would change or add: 1) add the name of the character under the actor’s picture in the “about” section, as the IMDB picture doesn’t always match their appearance in the movie or tv show; 2) make it possible to search the actors in a scene/cast while watching the movie or tv show (similar to the X-Ray feature on Amazon Prime); 3) move the trailers up to a more prominent place (you currently have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page on the “about” section. I didn’t discover the trailers until months after I started using the Vicki app); 4) add a customer feedback link to allow customers to make suggestions on improving the app or requesting to add specific shows/movies.",4,False,Vicki Customer,"Good, but could be great"

I got a response from the developer of this app to do all those things but those doesn’t work. It’s not a video issue either. My iPad’s Magic Keyboard doesn’t work on viki app, cannot pause the video using spacerbar and also cannot use the skip and go back arrow keys which works fine when watching YouTube videos and Netflix. Wish I can use my keyboard like that watching videos here. 🙏🏼

****Old review****
My iPad Smart Keyboard doesn’t work if I want to go back or skip for a few seconds. Sometimes you just need to go back when you have to read the subtitles that you missed to read, you know… and also the spacebar doesn’t work either to pause the video. Hopefully this can be fixed? 🙏🏼",4,True,taritz,Great app but….
