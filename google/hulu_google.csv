I canceled Netflix because it would turn off all the time in the middle of watching a move and the week I canceled I had uninstall and reinstall it 3 times and still didn't work right.

I really like how you can do premium add-ons like HBO Maxx, Cinemax, Starz, etc which is something you can't do with Netflix. I got all 3 of those add-ons and I can enjoy more and more of Hulu. I don't really use the mobile app but I stream on Roku and I just came on here to leave a good review. I also pay for ad free service which is only a little extra. A tiny bit more money to get rid of 6 ads in a row is worth it!! Thank you Hulu!!",5,4,,2021-04-21 19:04:09,,,

I love that i don't need to have cable to watch all the latest shows that are on cable these days. My one and only complaint is the fact that there is no start over or play from the beginning button. That should be a standard function. When you fall asleep and miss 40 minutes of a show who wants to sit and rewind all the way to the beginning. I need that functionality added on the next update.
