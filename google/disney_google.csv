Everytime one device logs into the app it forces us to change our password whenever another device in our household wants to log in. And once we do the other device that was signed in it logs out. We have tried to solve this issue by uninstalling and reinstalling and checking connection but nothing seems to be working. And its becoming more of a hasel than what it's worth just to change passwords. I hope this is an issue that becomes resolved.,3,17,2.25.2-rc3,2023-11-16 22:41:28,,,2.25.2-rc3

Works perfectly fine! every now and then it freezes but besides that it's a great app. Has some bugs like restarting the movie when you go back too it after leaving and buffering a lot but if you have a good internet connection should work perfectly work. Great app where I have a large variety of movies or shows too select. Great for car trips and movie nights where you can watch the good classic Disney movies. 10/10 would recommend.

Also just noticed there's no option to play from beginning. I feel like it's 1995 rewinding my kids favorite movie 3 times a day,2,0,1.1.3,2019-11-15 23:39:59,,,1.1.3

It is a brand new platform that is about 2 weeks old by the time writing so these minor grievances will likely be ironed out.
