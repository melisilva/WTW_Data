And then it would just loop to me trying to watch and then it telling me to select a plan and all that. So I canceled it hoping to get a refund bc wtaf peacock I just want to watch the office.

Would love to share a show with somebody and they can download your app and watch it too. If you had that function you would have got five stars instead of four. 🔑 Oh and by the way it does work fine with Chromecast. If you have issues try unplugging and plugging your Chromecast back in. That'll fix 95% of your problems.,4,6,2.4.7,2021-06-06 17:41:13,,,2.4.7
