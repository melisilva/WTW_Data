"MAX sucks now!  I've been an HBO Max subcsciber for years now. HBO Max brought in a lot of new subscribers by offering a Theater Movie release every single month. Not low budget movies either. I'm sure HBO lost money, but they gained millions of subscribers with that ""gimmick."". Discovery bought out HBO Max and they GUTTED IT! Discovery took out most of the good content & substituted with a 1/4 of the shows that are on Discovery+ and then raised the prices by more than 25%.  Discovery even renamed HBO Max to just ""Max,"" which is ridiculous!   In my personal opinion, Max wouldn't be worth subscribing to even if it was $10 a month.   Discovery+ on the other hand is worth the $$$ in my opinion. I subscribe to both Max to Discovery +, BUT this is my final month with Max.

A show wouldnt just completely disappear due to a technical glitch, while possible that is very very unlikely. Never heard of that ever happening.

Max has a ton of debt and have already said they are going to continue to remove shows to save on costs, and make then available to others to license

"I liked the 80's when, for the most part, different sections of media companies were in their lane, so to speak. Movie studios produced movies and TV shows. TV networks aired the shows. Radio, print media, and music companies were mostly in separate entities. I wish that were still the case in the era of streaming. But what began with the creation of the Fox Network, and the first big media merger of Time Warner, it's led to some of us making a choice of what lane we're going to stay in.

"People have been arguing Batman being a fascist or authoritarian for decades. Whether that is true or not, vigilantes are just plain bad for communities. The characters of Watchmen all come to that agreement (or at least they willingly come in from the cold), except for Rorschach, so the new hateful KKK-esque mob in the series props him up. I think it's done very smartly. You should definitely give it a shot if you're a fan of the comic, I was very shocked how much care was put into it.",,kcxt5fz,kcxmkmm,3,2023-12-11 20:03:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/hbo/comments/18fovec/watchmen_hbo_show_seems_to_have_randomly/kcxt5fz
"Oh I definitely think vigilante-sim is wrought with issues, [but there is a place for “frontier-justice” and the US court system has even held up vigilante Justice/ frontier-justice in a handful of cases.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_McElroy) there is a reason Batman is so popular, and it’s for stepping in when the bureaucracy of the law falls short. 

Now if someone thinks the Batman is fascist autocrat, they either do not understand what autocracy is, or they do not understand who the Batman is.

Batman’s super power isn’t super strength, or that he can fly: his power is that he’s the ultimate good-guy billionaire boss. Which can seem like a paradox if you haven’t read the comics. Batman absolutely people’s his workers over profits. The Wayne family funds hospitals, public transport in Gotham, funds orphanages, takes in orphans. In the road to “No Man’s Land” arc in 1998-2000, after Gotham was struck by a devastating earth quake, he put all his employees on paid PTO. His accountant refused, and Bruce Wayne almost fired his accountant for suggesting we don’t help people. Bruce 100% puts people over profits. He doesn’t kill. He doesn’t go after petty crime. He’s mentally I’ll, but he is a genuinely good man, who is compassionate and deeply caring. Open to being wrong and self aware.

He just plummets super villains into submission when the restrictions of the law falls short.",,kczcggz,kcxt5fz,1,2023-12-12 02:02:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hbo/comments/18fovec/watchmen_hbo_show_seems_to_have_randomly/kczcggz

"I resubscribed to HBO Max about 2 months ago, and it’s already been almost a week without this bug being fixed. I have two TVs that are having this same problem. Wondering if anyone else had this happen to them and/or knows how to solve it?


Update: 
Thank you for the helpful replies, unfortunately none of them worked. I even resorted to factory resetting the tv, and even now it’s struggling to download. 

What I did was I deleted the HBO max app and opened the max app, which was automatically downloaded for me, but when I opened the app a screen came up telling me to install the app. I tried, each time it would load then say “application has not been installed. Try again.” So I did try, many times. Network connection was stable, I even deleted apps in case there wasn’t enough storage some how. I deleted the app, tried again and again. Then, I factory reset. The next day, it still doesn’t download, and same screen comes up.

Same problem. I have no idea how I did that but deleting my profile and recreating it fixed the problem. You lose your queue and watch history but that is fine with me. Sometimes it's good to clean the digital house.,,js3fab7,jrzf3ua,1,2023-07-15 19:26:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/hbo/comments/14zq7r9/why_does_hbo_hate_subtitles/js3fab7
"Just a heads up that might save you time: it seems like the Max app (like the HBOMax app) treats the trailers/commercials before an episode as a separate stream from the actual show. So if you're just starting an episode, get to the trailers/commercials, realize the subtitles are off, turn them on, and then you get to the show, and they're off again - I would recommend just waiting until you get to the show (intro or whatever), and then turn them on. If this is your problem it may save you from doing it twice.",,js0qpcy,jrzvrri,5,2023-07-15 03:51:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hbo/comments/14zq7r9/why_does_hbo_hate_subtitles/js0qpcy
"Executive egos my friend. I make a good living warning my company about the consequences of the decisions they're about to make. Sometimes they listen, sometimes they don't. Often when they don't work out or they went about the implementation wrong they will reach out to the person(s) that warned them to fix the issues. My only advice is don't be a d¡ckhole no matter how dumb the action may be. Staying positive through the ups and downs builds good rapport amongst the executive leadership community and workers down in the trenches.",,js3fzd4,js1fvew,1,2023-07-15 19:31:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/hbo/comments/14zq7r9/why_does_hbo_hate_subtitles/js3fzd4

"This is the first time in a few months that I'm actually looking forward to what's getting added next month. Here's some highlights to point out from this list:

* More CW seasons (Walker Independence, The Winchesters, and Kung Fu) are getting added on April 1, 6, and 7 respectively.
* TNT's The Last Ship (I guessing the only catalog shows that'll be added are the ones that share streaming rights with Hulu) - April 11
* Titans, Max Original Season 4, Mid-Season Premiere - April 13
* Clone High (2002) - April 14
* Black Lady Sketch Show, Season 4 - April 14

"Thats a minor part of this. They have always done this, rotating their WB catalogue, its their tactic to increase engagement with movies, and it works, the trending tab is always dominated by just added and leaving soon films. You can see a lot of the same films getting added and removed every few months and I've seen the majority of these films on the leaving section at least once already in the past year.",,jdfyo6c,jdfsavh,4,2023-03-24 02:43:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/11zvsrl/whats_new_on_hbo_max_this_april/jdfyo6c
