"Couldn‚Äôt find any threads about this show yet. Personally I‚Äôm not a fan, it reminds me of Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúTiny Creature‚Äôs‚Äù. Studio filmed nature docs set up with animal wranglers just aren‚Äôt my thing. I thought Awkwafina‚Äôs narration was great though.

I agree the wildlife wrangling takes away from the authenticity. Awkwafina helped but those grasshoppers sure seemed irritated at their filming schedule!

"Yeah, real footage, but there is a lot of green screen and compositing involved. There's a handful of CGI fly shots in the first ep, but I think that might be it for the series.

"Not true. It's almost entirely real footage. Some of it was filmed in a studio in front of a green screen or sometimes live video backdrops, but a huge amount was done on location in the traditional sense with skilled macro photography. There's obviously a lot of compositing of footage from the VFX team, to combine things into a single image, but next to no CGI bugs. The notable exception is the fly in a few shots on the city episode, as the comping didn't work as planned.

Disney+ app and website/tv is so basic with its features. Perhaps they should throw millions to the coders to make it better.

"The usual answer for something like this is some snarl with the licensing (probably music) and/or to low quality or missing parts.

The fact missing House of Villains that was on Netflix til D+ has me leaning towards it being a licensing issue.

The more glaring missing one for me is the Aladdin animated series which was probably the most indepth and expansive of that generation of their shows. That one I would bet is a missing/low quality content issue.

Buzz Lightyear was surprisingly good too with good world and character building. But at least that one we know the likely reason, someone high up in Disney HATES it.

Most of the time it would be something like that but every character and actor from this show is on another project featured on Disney+. Disney notoriously owns every single aspect of their animated properties with a few exceptions and those exceptions have since been public domain  or bought out completely. No other streaming service owns the rights.

"For any media from before mid 2000s it tends to be a crapshoot if a decent quality copy exists of any given piece of video or audio media, or even just a home video copy and home video wasn't really an option before maybe 80s. 


And due to how many people look down on animation that lowered priority even further to properly preserve. If a copy does exist but to low quality then it becomes a question of if it considered worth it financially to restore it for rerelease, like the Snow White had done recently.


Some cases it just they didn't take proper precations, others it is didn't take any and destroyed after broadcast to make space, others lost in fire, or thrown away when a company goes under or is bought literally just tossed in a dumpster. Film can be a pretty damn volatile medium even when treated perfectly.

An example is last Dec the 1977 Mr Roger's Christmas was recovered after being lost for decades. While opposite side a large chunk of early Doctor Who is just gone. There a few communities dedicated to trying to find lost media, including an active subreddit.

"Literally any Pixar film except for Coco (but Coco isn‚Äôt like traditional musicals in that the music is actually part of the plot and it‚Äôs all normal musical performances (like on a stage with an audience or a parent singing a lullaby to their kid) instead of a character randomly bursting into song in a way that would be considered very weird if it happened in the real world). Note that some Pixar movies (specifically the Toy Story and Cars movies, and Brave) have (usually licensed - meaning not written specifically for the movie) music with lyrics however they‚Äôre used in a way that isn‚Äôt any different than using a score (instrumental song composed specifically for the movie) instead and are mostly in scenes that are montages (sequences where there wouldn‚Äôt be much if any dialogue to begin with regardless of what music is used). A number of movies have licensed songs with lyrics during the end credits.

Many of the recent Walt Disney Animation Studios films aren‚Äôt musicals. The only recent ones (released in 2012 and newer) that are musicals are both Frozen films, Moana, and Encanto.",,jgiw2r4,12ojffp,1,2023-04-16 21:20:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/12ojffp/animation_recommendations/jgiw2r4

"I subscribed in the first wave of Disney+ accounts and had Hulu (No-ads).  

Today I went to update my payment method and both Hulu and D+ were bugging out so much I had to contact support. 

Previously I would get a discount from D+ for the difference between Hulu with ads and Hulu without so I wasn't paying more than $15 a month for Disney. 

As of right now Hulu without ads is $15 a month. 

Then Disney is charging me $7 a month for a grand total of $22 a month. Their system said I had Disney with ads, but I wasn't getting served ads. 

So someone somewhere buggered things and it's impacting their longest subscribing customers. 

The best they could do... A $7 refund. Which is super insulting considering they've been overcharging me for who knows how long. That's neither here nor there.

"I had the legacy bundle. When D+ first launched the way the bundle functioned was as such:

You subscribed to D+ bundle for $15 a month. The only bundle available was Hulu with ads and D+ didn't have an ad option yet. You did not have the option to subscribe via Hulu.

If you had Hulu with no ads already, they would subtract the difference between Ads and No Ads Hulu from your D+ bill. You had to go to this special Hulu website to link the two. This special Hulu page no longer exists.

When the trio bundle became available on Hulu and D+ for 19.99 and no ads, they did not adjust the Legacy bundle users correctly.

So anyone who started with D+ in the first year and has Hulu with no ads is currently getting overcharged by $2 a month.

"Update: It‚Äôs changed back to 109.99 dollars at my iTunes subscription page now. Haven‚Äôt charged me yet.

Update 2: Apple did charge me 79.99 dollars just now. Don‚Äôt know about next year.

I have a habit of canceling any streaming services right away in case I forgot about them later. I did the same thing with Disney plus annual last year before the price hike.

I have a bit of regret ever since because now in my iTunes account subscription settings it says I need to pay 109.99 dollars to continue the service.

My subscription ends tomorrow so I decided to bite the bullets hearing that another price hike is coming. So I continue the service in my iTunes subscription page. To my surprise, it now says it will charge me 79.99 dollars tomorrow. 

So you can still enjoy the original price even if you cancel the subscription before as long as you continue the service before your subscription ends.","PSA: If you subscribe Disney Plus via iTunes before the price hike, you can still continue the service using original price",15ypkk7,0,17,2023-08-23 02:42:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/15ypkk7/psa_if_you_subscribe_disney_plus_via_itunes/

"I think it‚Äôs really dumb on Disney‚Äôs part to have two massive price hikes in less than a year. For anyone who gets hit with both at once (which is anyone whose subscription renews between I think early October and mid December, which includes all day 1 subscribers in the US), it‚Äôs an increase of nearly 50% to stay ad-free. There‚Äôs a lot of people who will never watch ads, so I wonder how many will cancel for good or only resubscribe for 1-2 months per year when they see this increase. A not insignificant number of young people don‚Äôt check their emails regularly, which is the primary way of informing people of price hikes for anyone who doesn‚Äôt pay attention to streaming service or Disney news, so there‚Äôs a decent chance this will piss off a lot of young adult subscribers (who unfortunately won‚Äôt have any recourse if they want to cancel or downgrade over this but don‚Äôt notice until it‚Äôs too late, as customer service is not required to issue refunds in these cases). The price itself is still fair, but at this rate, they‚Äôll be pushing the boundaries of being reasonably priced in a year or two, and people will be turned off by the rapid increase, regardless of the fact it went from underpriced to reasonable.

I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until these rapid price increases, among other issues, backfire hard on Disney.",,jxdbg9z,jxd8lr8,4,2023-08-23 05:04:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/15ypkk7/psa_if_you_subscribe_disney_plus_via_itunes/jxdbg9z

*Everybody* has this issue.  This is why the market for streaming sticks & boxes even exists... b/c TV manufacturers have no incentive to keep their TV's updated and fix issues.  They don't want to sell you a TV that'll last 20-30yrs.  There's no profit in that. They want you sell you a $500-$1000 set every 3yrs.

**Overview**

Using the medium of video games, *Wreck-It Ralph* explores what happens when the assigned villain of a narrative decides he doesn't want to be the villain anymore. Feeling insecure and discontented after thirty years of playing the heavy, Ralph sets out on a quest to change his destiny and gain the respect he craves.

**Point by Point**

* As in *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* and *Toy Story*, the filmmakers here were able to sprinkle in a generous assortment of licensed characters amongst the original cast, and, within the first few minutes, we're treated to cameo appearances by several video game icons. There's Bowser and Dr. Eggman; M. Bison and Zangief; Pac-Man and Q\*Bert and Frogger, among many others. There's no question this background population of recognizable characters makes *Wreck-It Ralph* that much more fun.
* It really is pretty shabby to throw a party for the thirtieth anniversary of *Fix-It Felix Jr.* and not invite Ralph. I mean, I get it, he's a big, clumsy guy, but you could have had the party outside.
* Determined to win a medal and prove he has what it takes to be a hero, Ralph infiltrates a first-person shooter called *Hero's Duty*, and is immediately overwhelmed by how ‚Äúviolent and scary‚Äù it is. We become more familiarized with the concept of video game characters as performers as we watch Sergeant Calhoun engage dramatically with the player, represented in-game by a drone equipped with a monitor. It's a neat concept.
* The world of kart racing game *Sugar Rush* (where Ralph ultimately ends up) is extremely well done; colorful and very attractive to look at, with everything made out of candy, cookies, and cake. Disney could have made a whole movie based on this premise alone. King Candy is a conscious homage to Ed Wynn, who, among many other things, provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in *Alice in Wonderland*.
* Ralph and Vanellope play off of each other well, although I didn't really sense quite the winning chemistry between them that the best Disney duos enjoy. The climactic race through the diverse environments of *Sugar Rush* is fun and exciting, and the stakes only heighten when the Cy-Bugs from *Hero's Duty* invade. King Candy turning out to be the demented Turbo in disguise is a good twist. In the end, Ralph uses his knack for destruction to save the day. In embracing who he is and what he's meant to be, he becomes the hero.

**In Conclusion**

I've been a video game enthusiast since the early 1990s, so I enjoyed the many cameos and references to real-life games. I couldn't get super invested in the story or the characters, however; it was fine, just nothing that really pulled me in. I enjoyed *Wreck-It Ralph* while I was watching it, but it just doesn't have that wow factor for me.
