"I feel like everyone loves these types of shows (Love on the Spectrum, this new one about Down syndrome) but do they rub anyone else the wrong way? I can’t quite put my finger on what it is but they all feel very inauthentic and just waaaaaay too wholesome. Yes, not all shows have to have seedy aspects to them, but the families profiled never talk about any real life issues, everyone is just so happy and shiny and sure that their child is ready for long term relationships. Maybe someone else can express it better.",Down for Love bugs me,15p9jx2,0,39,2023-08-12 17:55:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15p9jx2/down_for_love_bugs_me/
"My ex-sister-in-law was Down syndrome. Janelle was exactly like these young people. She was always positive and full of love, exactly like these young people are. They are authentic.

Personally, I’m ok with not hearing the back story from the parents. They don’t need to explain their life issues with a Down syndrome child to anyone. 
They just want their child to have the best life they can.",,jvw4fta,15p9jx2,44,2023-08-12 18:02:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15p9jx2/down_for_love_bugs_me/jvw4fta

"My brother-in-law has Down syndrome and my husband and I love the show. Ever since I met my husband’s family, his brother has been just another part of the family. They’ve never treated him differently or spent time complaining about how hard he makes life. I think it’s a bit rude to assume that the wholesomeness, supportiveness and love isn’t genuine. 

Sure my BIL has caused some issues with his special needs and he’s different than other people, but we love the shit out of him and his entire family including my husband have always just loved him for who he is. And I can confirm we would absolutely love for him to find a partner. He is very kind, goofy, generous and loving and deserves nothing but the best. He is also insanely positive.

"The one pattern I have been noticing with shows like Love on the Spectrum and Down For Love are they set them up on a blind date, and then it fails after the first and second date (for the most part). To me it feels really scripted and feels like it's all part of of an act. I understand it teaches people that not all first dates are destined to be your life-long relationship, but to do it almost every time feels predictable after a while.

Movies have taught us to build this egotistical mind where we are entitled to having a man or woman for granted, which is not how the real world works. People have to work on loving themselves first by being the best person they can be, before putting themselves out there in the dating world. These types of shows don't show it and it's teaching people that they can go out there and expect good things to come out of it, like in the movies.

Back to the show itself. I watched one episode so far, and I have some issues with the way they handled it:

1. The teacher going along with every answer Josh gave him, instead of correcting them and giving him a harsh feedback.
2. Josh's family encouraging him to drink alcohol and making himself look like a fool on the dance floor is really poor taste in judgement. Downright degrading and humiliating if you ask me. Anytime I am with my family, I would not want them to see me in a completely different context, and also make a major production if I were to interact with a random woman. When I'm with my friends, different story.
3. You can tell Josh was totally unprepared and they did not really prepare him in the dating world at all. While failure is a good thing, it can lead to improvement to fix any of the bad flaws from the previous date.

Other than that, the show is fine so far. So far, Josh is by far the funniest/quirkiest character in the show. I will watch more of them and give my review on each of the episodes later.",,jx756ar,15p9jx2,6,2023-08-21 23:54:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15p9jx2/down_for_love_bugs_me/jx756ar

"What could be off about packaging the personal lives of intellectually challenged people for consumption by a reality tv audience?

Regardless of how authentic what they are showing us is (in an inherently manipulative and exploitative-by-design medium like reality television), why is it ours to observe in the first place? Seriously, I saw the title card ‘Down For Love’ with a picture of some people with  down syndrome, and assumed someone was making a poor-taste joke about the already ridiculous Love on the Spectrum. When you think about how sensitive the world is today with people desperate to take offence at anything and everything it’s insane that this is given a pass. 

The only reason is because those exact people in this instance are able to tell themselves that because they think the down syndrome folks are “just so cute” it makes them a good person. They’ve dressed up patronising and exploitative voyeurism as feel-good inclusivity, and just the right people fall for it.",,k1iqb25,15p9jx2,2,2023-09-21 05:08:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15p9jx2/down_for_love_bugs_me/k1iqb25

I agree 100%. Watching it almost feels like it's extremely forced bad acting as if it's not natural at all and they just do it for tv.

"Hi!

I have a Lg A1 oled Tv.

My tv was working fine before but I did a factory reset to free upp some space and make the tv a bit quicker. I used same settings as before the factory reset.

I noticed in netflix only with dolby vision that the subtitles was really blurry. If i look close the subtitles are dublicated on top of each other. If i try to change around with the subtitles settings in the netflix app the subtitles shows correct first in the preview but then act up wierd and some as a white block/bar.

Anyone know how I fix this? I have tried to delete and reinstall netflix but same problem with subtitles. Also tried to do the factory reset again.
The problem seems to be with the netflix app. Before the reset I had no problems with the subtitles in dolby vision.

A week ago, I had a customer support chat session about something in the android app. I requested a chat transcript which arrived promptly by email. All fairly normal so far...

This is where it gets weird. Since last week, I've received 50+ copies of the chat transcript (zero interaction from me). Every 12 hours I receive 3-4 copies of the transcript. I suspect the emails will continue arriving until a fix is deployed by Netflix.

Anyone ever seen anything like it? Any way to get it investigated? Customer service have not provided any updates since I reported it last weekend.

I contacted support chat, and they are again reiterating the same info.  


How can netflix decide to force customer to use latest OS.

So how can netflix force customer to update OS to provide seamless service when you are making customer's device experience worse by forcing them to update to a unstable OS.   
Surely this is responsibility of apple to fix the os bugs. But how come netflix gets to say you need to update OS.   


I checked their terms and service as well and no where they mention that you agree to use netflix on latest OS version only.  


Surprisingly they dont show same error on chrome or edge but its capped at 720p. So for me the seamless experience has become a faulty experience. I am paying for 1080p subscription and I dont get to enjoy it because of the stupid technicality.  


I know the workaround to reset PRAM DRAM registers but that also bring more troubleshoot steps like backing up the data.

"I’m hoping someone else has encountered this bug and figured it out already, but when I go to watch the English dubbings of foreign language movies, the dubs that say they’re in English often don’t actually play  English audio. Frustratingly enough, when I select ‘English dubbing with audio descriptions’ it *is* in English, but then I have to deal with the audio descriptions of everything on the screen. 

This most recently happened on the movie “Christmas as Usual”, but also happened several months ago on “Faraway”, which also never resolved for us.

"On Christmas As Usual, I just ended up playing the original audio and it turned out  to be in English, surprisingly. I never finished it, but I assume maybe there’s some parts in Norwegian that they just subtitle automatically. 

Also, the English dub is usually the second option to come up, if there is dubbing offered. If you start searching all those other options you’ll find yourself in the “audio descriptions” setting. I rarely go too deep into the “more options” section because of that. 

(And yes, I know the original language audio is always better but sometimes I am doing other things and need to be able to hear the dialogue, not just read subtitles.

The military: why the fuck do they still do their job and not just do nothing and/or everything they want the way literally everyone else presented does?

Basic societal functionality: How exactly do power, water, etc all stay on if no one works or has incentive to? On top of that, who is flying these planes to Tibet, Paris etc.? Who is doing baggage handling, servicing the planes, cleaning etc.? Who is transporting food cross country, tending the farms, hauling garbage, etc.? Is it just middle class and up that get to wallow in self pity and travel and do absolutely whatever they want? Is this a subtext about how the world will still stay awful and unfair, even with impending apocalypse?

"I think they did this because they wanted to. Maybe they wanted to feel normal, were workaholics, were too afraid to pursue their dreams (“maybe the things they idealised wouldn’t be so great after all?”) or working was their dream, maybe they wanted the structure or help people, have an impact on their lives. 


This show made me wonder about what I would do if the world was about to end.. and in a way it will. I’m gonna die one day, like everyone else, the difference is that even without us life will still exist and new generations will continue our legacy. But back to the topic:


I’m currently unemployed, so I came to appreciate working. I miss being occupied, being productive, having a schedule. If the world was gonna end in a year from now I’d be working.

"I feel like it's pretty easy to explain away the military. Serving members are promised access to some sort of last ditch effort to survive the impact or escape the earth. I could see what fragments of the government exist lying in order to keep stuff from descending into anarchy.   
More likely though the government, public service jobs, grid infrastructure is all being handled by other ""Distractions"". Given the opportunity to do whatever they want, I feel a lot of people would want direction more than anything.   
A vast majority of the people in the show's world just want to keep doing the same thing out of comfort. I think it speaks to the power of the conditioning in the world we occupy. And we kinda get a glimpse of this with the Somalian Pirates, who keep pirating, despite there being nothing of value to steal.  
Why would they keep pirating? Just grab a ship and go wherever you want to go! But, they don't do that til they make a human connection. Because before that, pirating was all they knew.

"I just finished the show and frankly I don't think it's supposed to be all that deep. My IMMEDIATE reaction less than 20 minutes into the first episode of this was ""okay, so this is all about depression and was clearly written by someone in the midst or aftermath of it"". It reminds me of Another Earth insofar as the science and ""why's"" aren't really supposed to matter, it's not hard science, it's more about the abstract. Episode 2 made that even more abundantly clear with The Distraction. I don't even have to call it a metaphor, the show certainly doesn't try to hide it.

The one thing I did appreciate though is at one point during a newscast a guy (presumably a scientist) says that Kepler will impact with the equivalent power of 10 million Kiltons.

This is not only a real method of blast yield measurement but also a very likely potentially apocalyptic level of yield.

For reference: The largest man-made explosion on Earth prior to 1942 and still largest man-made non-nuclear explosion on Earth back in 1917, The Halifax Harbour Explosion, was a tragic accident that erupted with the power of an equivalent 2.4 Kilotons.

The first successful nuclear weapon ever detonated at the Trinity Test in 1942 was 18 Kilotons.

Fat Man (dropped on Nagasaki) and Little Boy (dropped on Hiroshima) developed later that year were 21 and 19 Kilotons.

The Tsar Bombas, the single most powerful weapon ever detonated on Earth and first true thermonuclear Hydrogen bomb, was detonated in the 50s at 5 Megatons (5, 000 Kilotons).

The Chixulub Crater that was left behind in the wake of the K-T Event when the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs impacted Earth's virgin surface 65 million years ago and precipitated the K-T Event that wiped out most large and reptilian forms of life and led to the dominance of modern mammals...was roughly 100 Teratons. 1 Teraton is equivalent to roughly 1 million Kilotons or 1, 000 Megatons.

It killed and completely wiped out roughly 75% of all life on Earth's surface (next time you feel hopeless just think about that, more than half, and yet we still beat the odds).

Thus, Kepler must be on-course to, according to this man in this quick episode dialogue, impact at roughly 0.1 Teratons, potentially more so let's be conservative as we can assume he's being at 0.2 Teratons. He just chose to say it the long way at ""10 million kilotons"" probably 'cause most people don't know what a Kiloton is let alone a Teraton.

That's still more than enough to cause a near-world-ending catastrophe. Life itself is definitely not ending and Human life actually still has a pretty good chance here...but modern civilization and likely functional civilization in general is definitely dead for quite a while after this and a dark age is definitely coming for quite a long time in the wake of the disaster with plenty of extinctions.

Edit: Rewatching the show (as I usually do with stuff I like) and that little quick snippet newscast is in the first 5 mins.

The guy says ""10 million Megaton"" not ""Kiloton"". Yeah that's like fuckin' 10 Teratons, chances are much worse.",,kf2jfmq,18lvugh,3,2023-12-27 02:27:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/18lvugh/carol_and_the_end_of_the_world/kf2jfmq

"I didn't buy the conceit at all from the get go. But it's not meant to be literal or realistic, and once I let it go, I was fine with it. 

The show is a philosophical treatise on what it means to have a fulfilling life. The idea is that all these people are out chasing ""meaning"", while Carol is finding meaning in the mundane and in human connection. The most profound point of the show for me was the idea of her learning the names of everyone at the Distraction. You have to treat everything about Keppler 9C as a metaphor without substance. 

The other thing you should reflect on is that the show is very specifically set in California and it's making a point that all these people who are ""following their bliss"" are rich, privileged Americans, and it's often at the expense of others. So you see that with the sea captain, with the pirates, with the Tibet storyline. You also see how things are very much not ideal for a lot of people in the episode with the vampire boy who is seemingly abandoned by his parents. Those who can live out their days ""not caring about anything"" are the privileged few. It's self-aware, so I forgive the invisibility of the ""NPCs"" who keep things running for those who are seeking happiness. 

Our world is much the same -- look at how Elon Musk chases happiness and fails to achieve it. The Tibetan storyline was paralleled almost exactly in Beef with Maria Bello's character. We are the ones in the background making things work. We do NOT get to chase happiness. But that's okay because true meaning is found in human connection.

"Just a random observation I had:

In an early episode we see Carol's high school yearbook from 1978. As Elena mentions in the hiking episode that Carol is 42, that would mean that the show is set in 2002-2005, assuming that Carol was aged 15-18 in 1978. On top of that, not an iPhone in sight, and the Applebee's in the show uses the same logo that was used at the time before it was updated.

I wonder why they would set the show during this time... Seems like more people would be able to relate to it if it was set in the age of social media, etc.",,kfd7veg,18lvugh,1,2023-12-29 03:46:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/18lvugh/carol_and_the_end_of_the_world/kfd7veg

This seems slightly more realistic in the first few episodes, with Carol going to the ruins of multiple Office Depots to scavenge for toner, or Donna checking out at abandoned grocery stores staffed by the military.

But by the end of the season, the whole point is that you're more invested in the character drama and personal struggles than the world building, culminating in HR's investigation.",,kfxk76n,18lvugh,1,2024-01-02 03:54:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/18lvugh/carol_and_the_end_of_the_world/kfxk76n

"In a way, I think everyone is looking into this show much to literally.

Just to everyone's reminder- could be tomorrow.

This show brings so much depth and a sense of eeriness. It shows that if everyone were to truly do nothing for a prolonged period, we would eventually drift back to the capitalist society we have been bred into. We would work.

The truth is no one has enough hobbies or ambitions to occupy oneself, so eventually we get bored. That is society. Welcome to the twenty first century.

"> They kinda get around it by saying that the military is taking care of basic societal needs, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief.

A lot of electricity and resources go into 'new things' or long term maintenance.

When you consider no new things 'are getting manufactured or made' anymore. And some amount of 'maintenance' simply not being needed anymore. 
They even mentioned during the show about some kid who had the last hershey's chocolate bar.

With a massive decrease in industrial water/electrical needs, they probably only needed skeleton crews to keep the basic things going.  
Also, with a known 'deadline of X months', and some amount of people dying for various reasons, some things could be kept going with quite minimal effort.

However this David Taylor case seemed to make no sense. His pants were torn, and they said covered in blood. Yet they said he had no trauma wounds or anything. So was it not his blood? And where are his ticket and phone?

There was like zero closure on this case. Yes, you found him dead. But with almost zero questions answered. But, hey, we found him, so we're done investigating.

Is there really no other intrigue from maybe a separate unit to find out what actually happened? He was driving everywhere.

"I also came here to complain about the pants! And the packed suitcase. Where was he planning to go? Start a new life? Why did his family never comment on that? Maybe he was high before he left the house? 

TBH, I kinda of guessed meth was the cause within the first couple of scenes, just looking at pictures of him and the family. But when they said he stopped at a gas station JUST to buy lighters? Definitely either smoking meth with a buddy (gay truck stop lover? Sex worker?) or planning to smoke a loooooot of meth on one’s own. My guess is he had a buddy, and that’s part of the reason he was driving all over town. 

Likely scenario is he drove around looking for a sex worker, picked one up, drove somewhere else to get (more) meth, stopped by the gas station for lighters… but I’m unclear on whether they followed him into the forest or if he met someone there. The blood on his pants (and the fact that this was brushed under the rug) seems to imply that some kind of struggle probably took place that they don’t want to discuss. Maybe it was a sex thing that the family doesn’t want to disclose, or maybe they made a deal with the cartel not to explore any further. 

But yes, I imagine the families’ wishes are a big factor in having the investigation filmed, and if they discover uncomfortable secrets along the way, those will probably be reburied and show up as nonsensical plot holes to the viewers.",,jmemhbg,13vktn6,2,2023-06-01 00:11:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/13vktn6/missing_dead_or_alive_david_taylor/jmemhbg

"Definitley agree that there was a lot of questions left unanswered but i would hope the case was just passed down to the detectives unit that deals with murder cases. They are only the missing persons unit so once theyve found someone dead or alive the cases gets passed on to other units. 

What I couldn't get over was the fact that when they called the woman that called 911 to get her statement they started the call with ""hey we got a call from you a few days ago"" why wouldn't they have gotten a statement from her sooner??? Is this a normal police procedure? I feel like that should be one of the first things that should be done as it is their first clue to help with how to proceed the investigation. Instead of going to the gas station first and watching the surveillance, I think it would have made more sense to investigate his tracks backwards. Start off where he was last seen from witness statements and when that is a dead end, continue on to the gas station. I feel like maybe they actually could have found him alive if they had done this.

"I'm surprised that nobody here came to the same conclusion as me...they discovered that he was wandering around asking for the lottery commission, all over town, including an area that police had said was a rough area full of meth. And the ticket was never found. 

I assumed that he asked the wrong person, possibly got injected with meth (whatever they had on hand for an impulse attack), so they could take the ticket. He was seen running across the highway, away from the white pickup truck, which could have been his attacker's vehicle. 

Since he doesn't do drugs (as his family said) he would've had a low tolerance for substances, and the result would have led to his death. 

Their conclusion of ""oh he just got high and died and the lottery ticket went missing"" was disappointing, I agree.

" Hi.

This post is a tip on how to turn off HDR streaming video playback on Android 13 and higher.

I am a Galaxy user, and for several years I have seen posts on the Internet, especially when playing HDR videos on Netflix, that the screen is too dark to see. I personally explored this and found a way to block HDR video playback on streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix on Android 13 and higher and allow it to be played in SDR.

I couldn't find a way to do this on Android 12 and below.

Write it down briefly. You must use adb.

&#x200B;

Android 13

>adb shell settings put global are\_user\_disabled\_hdr\_formats\_allowed 0  
adb reboot

Once the restart is complete, enter the command below using adb.

>adb shell cmd display set-user-disabled-hdr-types 1 2 3 4

In Android 13, you need to reapply when you reboot the device. This bug is fixed in Android 14.

>adb shell cmd display set-user-disabled-hdr-types (reset)  
adb shell cmd display set-user-disabled-hdr-types 1 2 3 4 (reapply)

&#x200B;

Android 14 (requires testing)

>adb shell settings put global are\_user\_disabled\_hdr\_formats\_allowed 0  
adb shell settings put global user\_disabled\_hdr\_formats 1,2,3,4  
adb reboot

&#x200B;

HDR type 1: Dolby Vision, 2: HDR10, 3: HLG, 4: HDR10+

&#x200B;

Here is a small explanation.

>adb shell settings put global are\_user\_disabled\_hdr\_formats\_allowed

This global option is not present on the device by default, so it requires a reboot first after applying it. Afterwards, disable HDR through displaymanager’s shell command. This shell command was added in Android 13. It cannot be used on Android 12 and lower.

>adb shell settings put global user\_disabled\_hdr\_formats

This option is already present on my device, but due to the bug mentioned above, it does not take effect. I confirmed that it has been fixed in Android 14, and although I haven't tested it, I expect it to work.

[\[HDR\]:UserDisabledHdrTypes is not updated after system reboot (2392843) · Gerrit Code Review (googlesource.com)](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/2392843)

&#x200B;

I tested it on Android 13 and I can no longer watch HDR videos on YouTube and Netflix, they play in SDR. But if you play local video files they will still play in HDR. This appears to only be valid for streaming service apps.

I hope this helps someone.",TIP: How to turn off HDR video playback on streaming services (Android 13 and higher),16w46m5,0,4,2023-09-30 12:14:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/16w46m5/tip_how_to_turn_off_hdr_video_playback_on/

"  Netflix Began as a company in 1997 but as a streaming service only started producing original content in 2012. At the time that didn't matter because Netflix was able to sign many exclusive contracts with companies like Sony, Warner Bros, Viacom, etc to stream their ip's including breaking bad, south park, Batman, Cowboy Bebop, etc. The problem is recently these companies created their own streaming services so naturally they wanted their IP's as a draw and began removing them from Netflix. Most of these companies have many decades over Netflix when it comes to creating content: Warner Bros for example started 100 years ago and produced extremely recognizable IP's like Bugs bunny. Netflix on the otherhand doesn't have this massive back catalogue of originals to fall back on and is forced to come up with as many originals as possible hoping one will be the next Stranger things or use create partnerships with other IP holders to create spinoffs like Cowboy Bebop, The Adams Family, or Avatar. 

  To make matters worse Netflix never began the process of consolidation like some companies such as Disney with it's purchases of Star Wars, Marvel and Fox studios or HBO and Warner bros. Netflix needs to create temporary partnerships that may or may not be longstanding(think cowboy bebop), Contrast this to the many new Batmans, Star Wars, Supermans, Looney Tunes, Harry potter, these are massive franchises that can be expanded in ways Netflix can't do. 

  So To summarize Netflix has about ten years of original content to fall back on while Warner Bros/Disney have over 100 years worth of back content, Netflix appears often times to have nothing to watch because compared to many creators in genuinly doesn't.

"We have recently gotten a weird bug/problem when using Netflix. It happens across all versions of the app we have as well. 
It happens on our Samsung TV (older smart tv) and TCL TV (brand new Q8M) as well as three different generations of firesticks and an XBox Series X. 

Issue:
Netflix will load. We pick a show, watch the show and after credits black screen. No buttons will work during credits. No “play next” button. It stays like that for a random amount of time and will either crash or show the play next button or rate this show/movie. 

Same thing happens with movies. At end of the content ->same black screen, no inputs recognized etc. 

In the instances where button inputs come back and it unfreezes it never does it again the rest of the watch session. Until next boot up of the app where the first piece of content we watch ends in this black screen freeze again. 

Really hard to google something like this. 

Since it’s happening to us on multiple versions, devices and hardwired versus Wi-Fi connections, I’m starting to think it’s an issue on the Netflix side not our side.

"Aspect ratio is the relationship between the vertical and horizontal sizes. Ever be resizing a photo and see 4:3 or 16:9? It's like a percentage. If you divided the longer length, typically horizontal, into 4 parts, the vertical would be 3 of those. So 4:3 could be a monitor that's 24"" wide X 18"" tall.

When they say your aspect ratio is off, that means it's taking the movie size and fitting it to your vertical screen, but it's too long, so the rest is hanging off the right side. I have the same problem, and I just maximize my browser so it fits horizontally, but the top & bottom of the browser is still visible, instead of just blacking it out.

The parents get transported into the kids’ bodies. Sounds fine on the surface, but most married people are sexually attracted to their spouses. This means that the parents in kids bodies are either A) attracted to their children in their spouse’s body, or B) still attracted to each other, but in their children’s bodies. I don’t want either one of those things to be true and the therapy afterwards is going to be intense. 

Also, for the kids, they now have to shower and use the bathroom and all the things, which makes them have to see and deal with their parents’ naked bodies.

"As far as I can tell this appears to mainly occur with shows that use English as the native audio. I should also point out that I don't have an issue with Closed Captions options being available for the deaf or hard of hearing, what bugs me is that Closed Captions can sometimes be the **only** English language subtitles option.

I don't understand why Netflix don't make subtitles available both with **and** without Closed Captions. If I need to switch on subtitles for some reason and the only option is English [CC] then it's necessary to put up with additional descriptive text such as:

[wind howling]

[footsteps crunching]

[grunting]

and so on ..........

Surely it would be incredibly simple for Netflix to make two options where required:

English
English [CC]

They wouldn't even need to create a separate file for each option, just employ a filter that removes all text within square brackets.

I will say that my hearing is fine but sometimes the sound mixing is a bit off or the dialog is muffled for some reason, in those cases I turn on subtitles and, if CC is the only option, I then need to put up with the descriptions too.

Wanted to bring this up because people usually just talk about the catalog and never actually the experience of using the app. For example parental control is awful.

You can ONLY set one pin and that pin can only be used on kid profiles so there is no way to lock your own account so the rest of the family doesn't use it,  nonsensical...

* cannot click on a cast member to see all their movies/series

"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out to this community not just as a gamer, but as someone seeking a bit of solidarity. I play “SpongeBob: Cooking Out” on Netflix games, which, albeit not widely known, has been a source of joy for me. Unfortunately, a recent update has left the game inoperable, and I'm concerned it won't be addressed due to the game's limited popularity.

The Problem:
An overlay from the “Fry Cook Games” event is now uncloseable due to a non-functioning claim button, and a repetitive menu pops up after every single interaction. It’s more than a minor glitch; it’s made the game unplayable.

The issue has been ongoing since October 25th, as seen by a series of 1-star reviews on the Google Play Store from other dismayed players.

A Personal Request:
I've contacted Netflix support, but I fear without a louder collective voice, this bug may go unfixed. If you have a moment, I’m asking for your help. You don’t have to play the game or even like it, but your support in raising a ticket could make a huge difference.

The request would just be that you raise a ticket asking Netflix to disable the fry cook games event until they can fix it. This would return the game to us fans, and be relatively simple to do.

It's a small request, but for those of us who enjoy these little escapes from reality, it means the world. Thank you so much for considering this appeal.","r/Netflix, please lend me your voice!",17pqgyz,0,1,2023-11-07 09:26:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/17pqgyz/rnetflix_please_lend_me_your_voice/

I remember he had to walk down the train tracks for many miles and his feet were all cut up and blistered. He ended up stealing a car and maybe even boarding a plane.

"I'm only on part 2 episode 4.  I'm liking the characters and story so far but I have a couple minor nitpicks

First, lacasa de papel is a much cooler name than money heist, why did they have to change it?  I guess house of paper was too close to house of cards so they didn't want any confusion.  But money heist is still a dumb name.

Second, the close up shots of guns.  Not sure if it's because as an American I'm more familiar with weapons than European audiences but it bugs me a little when they show close up shots of guns and they are very clearly using blanks.  I get that incompetent and reckless prop masters have cost human lives on set in the past and the safety of everyone working on set but there has to be a better way.  It ruined the immersion for me to see a belt fed machine gun obviously firing blanks and a revolver loaded with dummy rounds that have a dent in the primer from when they were previously fired and the actors are pretending they're live.  If they can't get realistic looking fake bullets or handle live ammo in a safe manner they don't need the close ups that make it so obvious they're using blanks and fakea.",Watching Money Heist now,167bbwl,0,1,2023-09-01 17:09:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/167bbwl/watching_money_heist_now/

"""What is the meaning of La Casa de Papel?""  


""Paper house  
“La casa de papel” means, literally, “Paper house”. But “paper” stands here for “paper money” = bills. Hence, it's the house where the paper money is printed and stored - the Mint.""  


Considering that above and that a heist by definition accurately describe the level of crime, it's not a simple burglary, then I think ""Money Heist"" works well enough :)  


The guns/ammunition did not even register for me and I suspect there are a lot of Americans etc.. who also aren't familiar enough to clock onto that.

"Agreed, the dubbed voices are awful.  I tried it for 5 min and had to switch back.  I'm also not used to hearing European Spanish, the accent sounds a little like everyone is speaking with a lisp lol. But that has nothing to do wjth the show

Aa far as the guns, there were really only 2 scenes where it was noticeable and only because they did extreme close up shots.  The Russian Roulette scene, when the revolver opens they do a close up and they have all been fired.  Looks like they shot live ammo on a shooting range, necked down the brass and reloaded something in there so when they want to show a loaded revolver on screen, you can see bullets in the cylinder from the front.  That sort of scene can be very dangerous for the actors so I understand.   The other scene was when police were trying to enter and they had to use the browning MG to hold them back and close up the hole.  Very intense scene but then they did a close up on the gun and the belt is full blank rounds with longer brass and a crimped end on the cartridge.",,jz0iv8a,jyyxoia,1,2023-09-03 23:38:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/167bbwl/watching_money_heist_now/jz0iv8a

"Hey guys, I have been having  resolution problems for 2 weeks. When I try to watch something on netflix from safari the resolution dips for some reason. It looks grainy. I checked the bitrate and it says that it's on 1920x1080.  Then double checked using chrome and eveything seems crystal clear. Without that muddy look. I compared the visual differences side by side on both chrome and safari and I believe that the problem is caused by safari. This problem started after I upgraded my subsciption to premium to watch 4K HDR. Now I cant even watch HD. Also, I'd like to say that I have contacted the netflix support on this problem and their reply was me to get the local membership plan. (I am an international student and I have a subscription from my home country.) I informed them regarding I'd thought that the main problem is not linked to visual bugs since I have been experiencing this solely on Safari and they replied again with the same attitude ""subscribe to the premium membership on local"". I know that it is only possible to watch 4k only on safari for mac so if anybody has solution to this problem I'd be really glad.

"so basically i'm trying to watch El Camino on Netflix right now and the picture is playing fine but the audio is only playing a \~5 clip from the Showtime documentary about John Belushi?? i'd record audio but my phone is dead & I don't have a charger rn. The transcript is a woman's voice saying, ""When he was young, he started drinking. He was abusing it and stopped. He did not drink,"" and then a man's saying ""He really was a hardworking guy, and away from the house a lot,"" and it's just looping over and over.

-so who had the limp? Only one who would be likely would be Allen but he didn’t seem to have the strength then to stab someone that much. A mistake by the neighbor?

-Wally made that comment about “biting and never letting go” when talking about his company logo, he seems strong and a little crazy so could be him. 

- i thought it seemed personal with that many stab wounds so I thought Will. Esp with that odd flashback showing she may have been alive while he was there? But then why would he have the car, that’s what brings me back to Wally since he has a connection to uncle/Allen. 

-who do we think showed up at Eli’s house either Will? Wally? I can’t remember but didn’t Will say something to suggest they’d know each other? Had they met? 

I know this isn’t necessarily the point of the movie but it’s bugging me lol. 

Also: I’m confused how Will’s mom said Summers commissions went into a house as a tax shelter that was “for the family” but summers not family so like how did they get her on board with that at least until she figured it all out? Or at least how would they explain to the cops how they got her on board bc that seems an odd thing to do with your money with no legal protections…",Reptile questions,171w2fz,0,9,2023-10-07 04:21:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/171w2fz/reptile_questions/

Not explaining Summers death is lazy. I get the director said he wanted to leave some mystery but why even bother making a movie about it at all. People don’t watch a murder mystery with the expectation that the mystery never gets solved. It’s counterintuitive and a waste of time.  I doubt they even know who killed her.

"I don't want to think Allen had a part in Summer's murder, but I think he might have been involved. It was mentioned that the person who bit her didn't bite hard enough to make useful teeth impressions and we know that Allen was starting to have some muscle weakness from his MS...maybe the bite mark was his. The limping man that was seen by the witness could also be an MS-impaired Allen. And the car was in his garage. Wally could have been the one to kill Summer if Allen lacked strength to do it himself, but Allen was probably there.

"Hi all, after reading some prior posts it seems like I am not going to get my money back from Netflix for duplicate recurring charges. I caught it after 3 months and I am trying to understand how I ended up with the double charges. I did learn that I have two accounts linked to my name, my actual account I have had for a few years and an old account under a different email I used for a trial in 2018 and canceled. In July 2023 I reactivated my actual account. This account is used on 3 devices and I checked all 3 devices and each was logged into the actual account as opposed to the old trial account email. I have always been subscribed to the basic HD package at roughly $17/month. The recurring duplicate charge on the old trial account also started when I renewed my actual account in July 2023 and it’s for the premium HD package at $22/month. The charges are to the same credit card. I have previously canceled/reactivated my actual account a few times with no issues in the past. My bank has an automated charge dispute but is not recognizing the charges as duplicates due to the different amounts even though the charges are both the same day each month. I have not shared login info with anyone. When I contacted Netflix they said they would close the old account but would not do anything else or tell me if there was activity on the old account.

"Has anything changed recently?

&#x200B;

I'm watching Dark (Season 2) and I noticed some artifacts so I pressed the info button and noticed it was streaming at 1.4Mbps! That's the lowest I've ever seen for a 4K show.

&#x200B;

I tried on my TV upstairs (closer to main router) and it was at 4Mbps (still much lower than I would have expected).

A speed test on both TVs consistently gets over 100Mbps and I've never had any issues before with streams being above 15Mbps.

&#x200B;

Just tried Our Planet II and it is around 8Mbps which again seems on the low side.

&#x200B;

Another thing to add - in the past I would notice a stream would start off low and slowly 'climb up' to around 15-17Mbps.  Now it seems to be a constant (low) bitrate which is quite odd in itself.",Netflix 4K bitrate seems quite inconsistent,15b5dzj,0,1,2023-07-27 16:49:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15b5dzj/netflix_4k_bitrate_seems_quite_inconsistent/

"One of the interesting things about Netflix is that they make it quite difficult to see what resolution you are streaming at.  A lot of devices  don't even support 1080p because of DRM reasons. My table will only stream at 960x540.  The only way for me to tell what resolution it uses is to look for the ""secret"" test pattern videos that display all the info about resolution and frame rate. 

I'm sure there's a ton of people with 4K TVs watching content in 1080p and they aren't even aware that they aren't getting 4k resolution. There's no way to force the app into a specific resolution.  Other than looking at your transfer speed, there's not much to make it obvious what resolution you are watching.

Even if you download a movie for offline viewing, there doesn't seem to be a way to download 4k content.  You can select ""standard"" or ""high"", but I don't think ""high"" even gives you 4k.

On a computer in the netflix app you can type Ctrl + Alt + Shift + D to see all the stats. I just tried a couple things and the results were all over the place. I'm on a 1080p screen, so nothing is going to show up in  4k, but Interstellar give 1080p while an episode of The Witcher played at 480p, but then I  tried again after and got 1080p. The problem is there's no way to force it into a higher resolution. It just tries to autodetect you connection speed, but if it gets it wrong, it's just going to stream in a lower resolution and not give you any indication that it's doing so and not give you a way to override it. My connection is pretty fast and a wired connection right to my modem which has 300 mbps connection to the internet, so there's no reason it shouldn't be 1080p every time.",,jtok5b8,15b5dzj,2,2023-07-27 17:23:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15b5dzj/netflix_4k_bitrate_seems_quite_inconsistent/jtok5b8

"I'll premise this with my opinion; this movie isn't for everyone. It isn't a movie for those who want an escape from reality with a happy ending and all the characters safe. This movie is intended to make you question, leave you bothered, and want you to discuss the symbolism and its relevance. I do understand some of the hate. MANY scenes were too long. I understand it was to build suspense, but instead, it built frustration since the scene was dragged on so often. The cinematography was nauseating at times, like the stair scene, which again may have been the intention, like the nauseous feeling you get when dealing with the unknown but it just didn't hit the mark for me. And finally, the ending was confusing. If nothing can be navigated, how are bombs being dropped on New York? With that said, everything else was amazing, I personally loved this movie and want to discuss the themes and symbols.

As a nerd for foreshadowing, I have to bring up that the oil rig, in some way, foreshadowed the plot. Rose first looks at the oil rig and mentions it is a big ship, which her family discounts. She is the only one focused on everything around her throughout the movie and is the first to reach the bunker. Simultaneously, it isn't until the very last moment that the family moves out of the way of the oil rig, narrowly avoiding it; the fathers both realize once the ""third step"" is complete, and Amanda and Ruth notice it only after the bombs begin going off.

This movie has some recurrent themes, starting with denial. The mother wakes up and desperately wants to escape the hustle of work life. She wants a break, and the denial begins instantly with her denying her husband the ability to deny the vacation. The denial is constant, with Clay denying that the oil rig is going to continue onto the beach, GH denying that the wife is dead, Amanda and GH denying the affair, and so on. I feel like the only time yes was said was when Danny said yes to giving Archie the medicine, which would likely be the climax of our story. The denial throughout the story is to showcase societal denial of the events and the danger that follows. Whether we care to admit it or not, we will deny the issues of today. 

The next theme is escapism. Through a direct jab at the Millennials and the obsession with sitcoms used to escape their reality, Friends was an escape for Rose. Archie tries to escape with masturbation and ignorance (mostly of his sister, who is much more privy to the situation since her escape was taken from her in the attack). Clay and Ruth use marijuana, and GH and Amanda use alcohol. I think this is relevant to the end because Rose, once the first to find a haven, explores it. And while we all are upset she doesn't bring food back to the house or tell her family, it is because she finally has her escape again and wants to escape the reality she's been facing so much longer than the rest of the characters. Again, how many times have you refused to do something and opted to escape instead?

Another theme is equality. We have 2 different families living the same truth. However, one owns a vacation home that the other rents because one has more wealth than the other. However, in this apocalyptic world, they are equal. Showcased again at the end of the movie with Danny, the money means nothing anymore. All that matters is their knowledge and preparedness. Danny, however, takes the money because it shows that he did the right thing morally, not literally. I think Danny didn't care for the money; he cared for the man and empathized with him. The other thing is that no home was ""off limits"". Even Danny, by the end, doesn't urge them away like he intended to do at the beginning of the interaction. He says he can ""offer conversation whenever they come by"" which he says at the top of his porch, showcasing that, at that time, he sees himself as a higher class than them. But by the end of conversing with them, the scene shows Clay walking away from Danny as they are on the same level. I think that it again shows equality when Ruth invites the dad into her bed. The dad denies it at first because he sees himself as her mere protector, trying to keep her safe, but by joining her in the bed, he realizes the equality of how she is trying to keep him alive just as much as he is trying to keep her alive.

The final theme is hypocrisy. Now, I hated the line Rose said about how ""we can't trust anyone, especially white people"" because it came out so randomly and was so abrupt compared to the symbolism of the rest of the movie. But I think that it was trying to show the hypocrisy. Rose thinks that the reason Amanda is hesitant to allow them in the home is because they are black, and denounces that worldview. But, this scene shows a true civil war since the country attacking is attacking the states since they are different, and the people inside the states are beginning to justify why they should attack each other through their differences. Something Rose denounces, she now sees herself doing. Amanda's hesitation to allow Ruth and GH into the home upset Ruth, but Ruth questions why they let Amanda and her family back into the home when they return. Just more hypocrisy being shown.

As for symbolism, I discussed the oil rig already, but let's discuss the other symbols. Firstly, Archie's illness. I think that the disease of the teeth falling out was to indicate the common dream/nightmare. Losing your teeth dreams could represent multiple different fears. But it either represents fear or loss, and I think it was to showcase that Archie's I don't care personality was rooted in fear and his loss, which wasn't really discussed much in losing his girlfriend. Secondly, the shed. I think the shed was supposed to symbolize the desire to escape. It is very baron in the shed, and it is raggedy and falling apart, yet nothing bad happens whenever anyone is in the shed. However, the world still goes on when they are in the shed. When Archie and Rose are in the shed, both the fathers are in extremely dangerous predicaments, but they are safe because they are ignoring their problems. I think it is reflected in the tic that bites Archie. He doesn't realize it until they have left the shed because he is escaping. Amanda and Ruth hear all the commotion outside and choose to stay in the shed for safety. But couldn't those animals have been running from danger? Instead, the animals are the danger. Yet the shed protects them, and it isn't until they leave the shed that we reenter the danger. This brings me to the last symbol, the animals. I am struggling to realize the animals' symbolism, but I am most confident that the deer symbolizes the need to move. Rose ""listens"" to the deer and finds the safe room, and Amanda and Ruth move erratically to scare the deer away. I also think the deer themselves are synonymous with humans since they are either seen running or idle, and not until the end do we see them walking. The same way the humans either sat and waited or ran once things got dire. The ravens we see at the plane crash site represent death, and the tick represents how we all can be squished like a bug at any time. The flamingo is the number one animal I have the least confidence in my understanding. I think it is because flamingos are often visualized standing on one leg, and at this point, the characters realize they are on their own since the government won't help them. Finally, what was the point of the loud sound that was made?

Anyway, that's what I found throughout the movie. I think it was interesting, and I mostly wanted to journal it for myself since I found the film fascinating.

"Good evening! :)

I just finished watching 'Red Rose' (2022) and overall, I really did love it! It's completely up my street, with the technology aspect, thriller, mystery etc, with a touch of the paranormal creepiness. However, having just finished it, I have questions, that I'm hoping people might be able to answer, or just see if I'm the only one with these opinions.

Also, I know the soundtrack has mixed opinions, but for the record, I really enjoyed it.  Putting a slower spin on 90s classics made them so chilling and eerie, which was perfect for the scenes they were used in imo.  Especially >!'Barbie Girl' - the slower speed forces you to really pay attention to the lyrics, and its use at Rochelle's funeral, sent chills up my spine with the disturbing context.  Genius move from the creators!!< 

I'm going to spoiler-hide the majority of this, just incase!

\---- The >!""ghosts"" on the phone, such as Rochelle's mother, Rochelle herself. Are we supposed to assume these are created digitally and superimposed onto the receiver's phone? I'm presuming so, although I'm not tech minded enough to know if such a thing is even possible. It just really bummed me out that they never explained that properly, when in the beginning, it was such a ""WTF"" factor. !<

\--- Wren's dad getting >!arrested. WHAT THE HELL. No, really, why didn't they just leave? Ok, her Dad had a busted leg, but they could have hobbled out the building and then called an ambulance or something? If there's no record for Red Rose having kidnapped Rick, there is no record of Wren having killed ... whoever the hell he was in the end.!<

And even if the police >!did rock up, and arrest him, there are enough witnesses to the overall crime, to be able to corroborate a self defence. Plus, Rick has been stabbed in the leg. Clearly it's self defence. He could have said he killed the guy to protect his daughter. Again, it just bugs me that we watch the poor sod being carted off, and not one person tries to fight for him. It's not poetic... it just seemed dumb.!<

\--- Speaking of the police... can we assume that the >!people watching Red Rose online likely called them, the moment Red Rose was deleted? If so, the police may be able to track those calls, which gives evidence to the real goings-on.  Potentially not though, if the observers of Red Rose are good at covering their tracks. But then, why would they even bother calling the police?  Strikes me that a group of people who find murdering teenagers funny, wouldn't really start crying about the potential death of one of their own. Or I dunno, maybe they would....but I can't imagine they'd help one of their own, at the risk of being discovered themselves.!<

\---- Jaya.... jaya, you're awesome, but for the love of God, >!WHY ARE YOU NOT USING A VPN? C'mon girl, that is beyond a rookie error.!<

\---- It just pissed me off in general that, even though we now know >!that Rochelle was murdered, and Wren has literally seen the video of it happening, that we're just... not going to report that to the cops and try and get someone interested in it.  It's not the 1970s anymore. The police know about the dark web and cyber crime. Even if Jaya deleted Red Rose, who is to say that the police, or highers, couldn't use the computer Jaya was using to observe Red Rose, and see if there is any trace of it as evidence.  Does this mean that her Dad and the twins will live their whole lives thinking she killed herself, with no justice?  I really hope not.!<

\---- The random woman who was >!The Gardener. She was very... panto villain. I don't hate her as a character, but she was just too random. I'd have loved it slightly more if she had been randomly used in background scenes.. that you will only clock her properly and go ""OMG she was there all the time!""!<

\---- Small bugbear but I REALLY wanted Patrick to >!be more involved. He was forever floating around in scenes, small interactions, but he was never utilised. As much as I like Jaya, I really wanted him to be the one meeting the group in Manchester. He says he loved Rochelle, and you saw how gutted he was at the funeral. After Wren's outburst, I wanted him to have done some digging of his own, and turns out he's not the waste of space everyone may have taken him for.!<

\---- Was the newsagent guy (where Taz tries to buy cider) the same >!medical dude that Taz sees in the hospital. before clocking that Ashley had been kidnapped from her ward? EDIT: Actually I just looked back and I don't think he is.!<

But sidenote: the >!medical dude - are we to assume he is a genuine medical professional, or just sneaked in as one? He definitely can get past the staff door sooo...!<

Honestly, if so, that is one of the most terrifying things - maybe of the entire series. For the series to acknowledge that here is a >!medical professional, someone in a position of ABSOLUTE trust, meant to save lives and look after people, and on the quiet, he's casually encouraging and enjoying the murder of teenagers. Of course, it's not without precedent - i.e. Harold Shipman. But still. Damn. That is a chilling edition to the show, albeit one that only lasts a matter of seconds.!<

Don't get me wrong, overall, I LOVED the series. It had way more amazing points, than bad, imo (it takes a lot to hook me so much that I binge a series that quick. Less than 48 hours in this case!) :)

Would I like a second series? Well it clearly is set up for that to potentially happen. But as someone in a different thread pointed out, the whole driving factor of this series, was keeping guessing who or what Red Rose actually was. Now we know, >!that mystery is gone. They would have to do something pretty clever and new with it, using Red Rose as the supporting concept, in order to capture the same audience again. It'd be interesting to see though. I'm not against it, I'm just not sure how you'd easily go about doing that. Either way, I do like the actual ending, that Red Rose has been brought back again, and my geeky heart enjoys that it resurfaces in Japan of all places, which has an amazing name in the world of horror movies.!<",RED ROSE (2022) Just finished - I have questions!,151e8di,0,12,2023-07-16 19:54:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/151e8di/red_rose_2022_just_finished_i_have_questions/
"My partner and I watched the entire season of Glamorous recently, and I've been trying to find an outlet for my feelings about this show - most of which are *negative*.  This was a bad show.

However no one is talking about it, except to say ""It's shallow"" and ""Emily in Paris meets Devil Wears Prada"".  

With nowhere else to really talk about this, and my peer group really isn't a ""talking about TV"" type people, I come here, to a Netflix forum to air my opinions.  Hopefully I am in the right place, as I really need to dump this out of my head space and not have it occupy cycles any more.  I apologize in advance for this, but sometimes you just have to let it all out in order to move on.  

First and foremost, this show is *awful*.  Let's just get that out of the way.  I watch a lot of LGBTQ+ shows, and as a baby-gay, I grew up watching some truly awful content.  In modern times however, I expect a lot more, but sadly, this ain't it.  

Let's also get the lighting out of the way.  They do that New-Kirk Star Trek lighting where all the lights in every building are too bright and flare across the camera lens.  It looks like they work in a spaceship.  It is cold, distracting and awful.  

The acting isn't great, which is expected considering the actors have very little character to work with.  The plot is stupid, and the whole premise of the show appears to be ""Kim Cattrall is a gay icon, worship her"", meets ""maybe an uneducated ditz can fix all of our corporate negligence.""  

I really want to talk about the work environment and how it relates to the characters.  The work environment and the employees are *toxic*.  We have a.... leader?  Owner?  President?  who ignores her director of sales, who in turn is hiding sales numbers that screws up the company.  Which everyone is okay with, once that comes to light.  Don't hire people you intend to ignore.  We have this leader randomly hiring people for a failing company, with no defined roles aside from ""exist near me and fetch coffee"".  This of course means that our lead (Marco) manages to Do It All, from rescuing product samples, to suggesting campaigns, to ""challenging the paradigm"", to running a social media account (despite there being a literal social media person).  This is our ""Emily in Paris"" insert, without the gorgeous backdrop of France.  

But it gets worse than that.  When Assistant #1 tells her date (not yet girlfriend, because it is like date 1 or 2) that she is thinking about moving from a dying company as an assistant to some kind of Exec for a Massive, Stable Company, likely for mega-bucks, she is told in no uncertain terms that she is disloyal.  She should sacrifice herself for the dying company.  She should lash her body to the mast of a sinking ship because ""that's what is right"".  When she doesn't seem keen to toss her entire career into the trash, and is still considering whether to stick with the dead job or move to a high-paying dream job, she's called ""flightly"" and ""insecure"" and ""immature"".  She ""runs when the going gets tough"".  

This happens *numerous times*.  And each time she ultimately decides to sacrifice herself for the dying company.  Quietly, without recognition.  She is told directly that by ghosting the Big Stable Company that she has nuked her potential career options.  In the final moments of the season, she reveals that her actions caused The Company problems, and is fired.  She sacrifices herself in order to prove her loyalty.  Which, fortunately, is rewarded by her being re-hired in a better role.  But that was not her expectation.  She sacrificed herself for the company, knowing it could literally destroy her life financially (she would be civilly, if not criminally liable for her actions).  For The Company.  

Marco also plays this game a few times, where they go ""balls-to-the-wall"" for a company that has literally fired them (see: return of product samples).  

&#x200B;

Then there is the gatekeeping.  The son of Kim is a Gaybro Stereotype, and is the ignored Director of Sales.  And whenever he mentions anything LGBT-related, Marco rolls their eyes and even says things like ""Who taught you that?""  Because he is cis-gendered, white and muscly, he's not allowed to participate in LGBT culture.  Yes, he has more intrinsic privilege than people of colour in the same LGB circles, and yes he has more privilege than trans persons of any skin tone.  Absolutely.  But he's still part of the community.  Gatekeeping is toxic behaviour, full stop.  Minorities do not get ahead by stepping on other minorities.  Even if one segment of the minority group is ""less minority-ish"" than another segment.  It isn't an Oppression Competition.  

If we were to extrapolate this trend out, we'd be building an eye-roll pyramid.  White, masc gaybro says something, gets read by a white femme gayboy, who gets read by a POC homosexual (masc or femme? Who has the priority?), introduce a few lesbians/bisexuals in the mix of different skin tones in this pyramid somewhere, all of which can get read by a trans person (again, we do the shades of skin and sexuality), who could then be read by someone with a physical disability because *how dare they* with their non-disabled privilege, who can be read by....  I mean, c'mon.  Gatekeeping doesn't help.  It's toxic.  It divides, it doesn't unite.  This show chose not to ""be better"".  

Toxic also defines the mother-son dynamic.  Kim is a *terrible* mother to her son.  She actively ignores him.  Only when he tries to run screaming into the night without her does she finally offer him some degree of attention.  Some bribe to remain where he is.  Which he turns down, fortunately.  But she is *awful* to him.  

Now don't get me wrong - he's a shitty person too.  He is toxic AF.  He is a manipulative asshole who lies about the company's finances.  He wants to get someone fired because he isn't getting enough attention from mommy dearest.  He faces no repercussions for any of his actions, if anything he is rewarded for it by growing as a person.  A little.  He is not a good person and he is terrible to everyone around him, which is a pretty common theme in this show.  I won't white-knight for the white gaybro.  I think they even named him ""Chad"".  

&#x200B;

Legal - this drives me absolutely nuts.  There are so many legal problem with this show that makes me cringe.  Kim finds that her car has been bugged during business negotiations.  They do not call the cops.  They do not start an investigation.  They just roll with it.  Son basically cooks the books, at least internally, so that Kim has no idea that her company is spiraling out of control.  That's fine, we'll go with it.  They apparently have a fleet of lawyers, enough to hire on Marco's mother, on a different floor.  Reasons unknown.  Assistant #1 steals corporate secrets and hands them over to the annoying Contractor, who hands them over to the buying company, that immediately begins launching the exact same product.  *Everyone* here deserves a lawsuit, but Assistant #1 takes ownership and is (briefly) fired for it.  Then rewarded.  Why is their company failing again?  Oh yes, they are too stupid to run a business.  

And finally, tragically, our lead.  Marco.  I've avoided talking about Marco because I don't know how to refer to them.  This one is the most toxic character of all.  Gatekeeping galore.  Selfish.  Annoying.  Inflexible.  Marco basically stalks a boy to get a date out of him, and when the boy fucks up, runs.  Okay it wasn't a great look, the boy wasn't comfortable bringing Femme Marco out in public.  Not good, breakup warranted.  But there's a speech, a cameo from a drag queen and all is forgiven.  The Boyfriend is reinstated and makes changes.  Says it is a process, and starts to change.  

Of course BF turns out to be too good, so they introduce a toxic trait out of the blue, for which he apologies and tries to change that too.  It's a process, he recognizes his faults and he tries to do better.  We see no future evidence of this trait, so I'd say it's working.  

Until there is a work function.  BF wants to bring Marco to a work function, where everyone is expected to act and look a certain way.  It's the finance industry, which is brutal.  BF being able to bring a partner at all, is extremely progressive.  Even BF has to put on a show and act a certain way, his employability depends on it.  Marco agrees, then changes their mind and shows up in full Femme Glory.  ""100% acceptance without any transition period, full change on your part and zero flexibility on mine, or this relationship is over"".  Marco could have just refused to go to the event.  Instead dumped BF on the spot.  Again.  

What Marco does with the designer boy is also toxic.  There's just so much to unpack there, and this post is long enough.  Just know it's a big old package of toxic, selfish assholery.  

Then there is the finale.  The game-changer.  Through the entire series Marco is portrayed as a gay male who is femme.  He likes to wear makeup and non-masculine clothes.  The audience accepts that Marco has had his journey before the show started, and is comfortable in who he is.  Some boys like to wear makeup.  Some boys like to wear heels.  They are still boys.  It's acceptable.  This is called Gender Expression.  Cool, that's a core premise of the show.  

In the final moments, we discover Marco is off to talk to a Gender Transition Therapist, and has told their mother that Marco is actually a trans woman.  

Nowhere at all during the show was there any of this.  There was no discomfort with genders, no conversation about deadnames, no journey of discovery, no sense of not being the right body.  Nothing, nada.  Whatever journey Marco went on, it was done without the audience.  

This leaves us with a *terrible* takeaway - femme boys want to be women.  That's the message.  The boy that likes heels and makeup and 'femme' clothes is actually just trans.  With Marco's transition, we have *no* femme boys in the show.  The closest we have is a background-character drag queen that wears ""masc"" clothes when they interact with the non-LGBT world.  

And finally.  The piece that cannot be forgiven, they left the best possible joke (given the circumstances) on the table.  That is unforgivable.  The entire series they have a Guy With Sunglasses who doesn't say much, and they keep saying ""we don't know what this guy does here, but he does something"".  The best joke they could land in this awful show?  During the final ""we saved the day"" moment of the series, have him approach our central cast, lower his sunglasses and say ""You're welcome"", then walk away.  How did he help?  What did he fix?  That's the joke.  It's not award-winning humour, but it would give us half a heart-beat in this otherwise stinking corpse of a show.  

This show is toxic.  The plot is thin and dumb.  The acting is flat and lifeless, confusing sass with character.  The premise is dreadful.  The ideas of a work environment are anti-worker and pro-corporate.  The message for both trans folks and for femme guys is regressive.  This show had better not get a 2nd season, it was so bad, it beggars belief.  

&#x200B;

If you stuck with me this far, thanks.  I had to get this all out somewhere.  Hopefully having said my piece, this dreadful show can be purged from my memory.  If you haven't seen the show and were considering it, hopefully this opinion piece will convince you not to.

"I actually loved that show. Although I agree with you about the ending. That caught me off guard and I didn't like it, it seemed like Marco was totally comfortable with himself and his gender identity the whole time and then out of the blue he's actually trans? It would have been interesting if they had talked about Marco's struggles with his identity at some point, but it didn't make much sense to me given how they presented things from the start. 

But apart from that, I think you took things wayyyy too seriously. It's just a lighthearted comedy, not meant to be taken literally. About the toxic behaviors, yes they would be toxic in real life, but it's just part of the characters' flaws and it doesn't mean that these behaviors are okay and that we should imitate them.",,jwb2tem,15mo2hn,2,2023-08-15 17:51:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15mo2hn/glamorous_on_netflix_a_review/jwb2tem

"100% agree. Glamorous is about: An unhealthy workplace in which a straight lady tortures a group of gay ppl with her  ridiculous whims. (Just emphasizing their sexualities here because I’m saying it’s supposed to be inclusive but the environment is just toxic.)  

It seems like multiple people on the Reddit say they like Chad but Chad is only likeable cuz he did all his shitty shit first and then got a redemption arc whereas everyone else was unlikedable cuz they were inconsistent throughout (ex: Britt) or did their dumb stuff later on in the show. vinetia was so dumb to give away company secrets. 

Production knew that Benny (who acts Marco) wanted to transition before they started shooting the show so they made the character trans as well but didn’t add any signs which just points to the idea that fem guys will eventually transition. This is terrible esp given the unaccepting ex storyline and that one scene where Marco chooses a little boy with long hair at the pop up store to get a makeover. 
I think the one sign of discomfort is that Marco never had his shirt off (probably because the actress wasn’t comfy and was already on hormones.)

"> I think you took things wayyyy too seriously

Possibly, though this is a show that is thick with Message.  ""Acceptance"" being the underlying one.  We are (rightfully) told to accept women in power, single parents, people of colour with authority and autonomy, homosexuality and diverse gender expressions, just in the very presentation of the show.  It may be a light-hearted romp through the makeup industry, but it comes with the (designer) baggage that most LGBT+ shows come with (and often fail at) - a message.  

There are countless numbers of hetero shows out there, so much so that they are the default and there is no underlying message about sexuality (aside from heterosexuality itself being ""the norm"").  With the small number of LGBT+ shows, each quantified by being Not For Everyone (that is, targeting just the LGBT+ community), the show lives under a magnifying glass.  All of its flaws are visible.  

And while the number of LGBT+ shows is smaller, it is growing, which allows us to not just accept what we're offered - we want more from our characters.  With ""Bros"" as an example, people weren't satisfied with a Harry Met Sally gay movie, they wanted *likable* leads.  They wanted depth.  And so Bros didn't do great as a result.  

Light-hearted or not, this show was swimming in message, the biggest of which was acceptance.  And one of the things this show accepted was really, really toxic behaviour between the characters.  It accepted the idea that one should put the Company ahead of the Worker at every turn.  

Let's take the light-hearted hetero flavour of this show - Emily in Paris.  It is a dumb, light-hearted romp through the Advertising Industry, and I dislike it intensely.  And yet my partner insists we watch it.  Household theatrics about television programing aside, the toxic behaviour in that show is primarily (though not exclusively) between friends, and always meets a Consequence - sleeping with your friend's boyfriend = bad news.  Dumping your bandmates = bad news.  Leading on a man when you are interested in another = hurt feelings.  Stepping on coworker's ideas to steal the spotlight = resentment.  Toxicity meets Consequence.  Even the work environment that Emily is fighting so hard for - when the environment starts to fizzle, she quits and joins a different company.  She looks out for Emily, she does *not* sacrifice herself for the company.  

The other comparison is Devil Wears Prada.  While our lead does sacrifice herself a lot for her boss, she ultimately chooses herself.  She learns and grows and discovers that throwing everything into a loyalty-free environment (see: Stanley Tucci's character as a cautionary tale) is a *Bad Idea*.  And she quits.  

So where *Emily* and *Devil* get it right, *Glamorous* doesn't.  

I'm all for light-hearted, but in a show swimming in message, that has a lot of cinematic history to draw from, it just doesn't land for me.  It doesn't make sense, and I think that as a community we are finally in a place where we can demand better from our LGBT+ programing.  

&#x200B;

At least we agree on the ending.",,jx4nn7y,jwb2tem,2,2023-08-21 14:29:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15mo2hn/glamorous_on_netflix_a_review/jx4nn7y
"Yeah, that was my thought too. Like how could he be a top, and then, want to transition to a woman where he would literally lose his penis? It was like they used the fact he was a top as an unexpected joke because he was femme, so one could assume the opposite at first. Definitely wasn't expected as he was dating Parker, but it became known once he started getting physical with Ben. 

I really liked that he was comfortable with being a gay man who liked to dress feminine and that didn't mean he couldn't be a top (I thought that was pretty empowering), but I can understand, at least maybe after his relationship with Parker, Marco wanting to be his authentic self and maybe questioning why he didn't fit with Parker. When you are in a relationship where you lose yourself so much trying to please someone else, it can mentally and emotionally affect you in quite a few different ways.

Love and sexuality is complicated, and I'd wish Marco the best. Maybe he felt he couldn't really be accepted as part of the LGBTQ+ community the way he was after being rejected by someone he loved the way he was. It shows a lot of insecurity for a character who is supposed to show confidence and authenticity in being who they are.",,k47d6b4,k1enjck,1,2023-10-10 00:48:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15mo2hn/glamorous_on_netflix_a_review/k47d6b4
"I am not opposed to Marco being trans, it's just that it wasn't a part of their story arc.  The show might as well have revealed that Marco was secretly a Jedi knight or a nuclear physicist or heir to the British throne, for all the connection it had to the story.  

If there was a journey of self-discovery here, the audience was not invited to participate in it.  Meanwhile it removes the element of having a femme gay male from the story.  We are told to accept that some boys like heels, traditionally feminine clothing, makeup, jewelry, etc, and they don't have to be trans.  That it's okay that their gender expression doesn't fit the stereotype.

The ending undoes that.  Their gender expression does fit the stereotype - they are actually female, so heels, makeup, etc all ""makes sense"".  And we have no femme boys left, with the potential exception of the Only Drag Queen in NY, and even they ""pass"" when out of the club.  

It's bad story telling.",,kgwg4ku,kgwes76,1,2024-01-08 14:51:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15mo2hn/glamorous_on_netflix_a_review/kgwg4ku
"It felt pretty obvious to me, the constant comments on Marcos makeup and how important it is to them, the gradual increase how femme they dressed, did their hair and make up too?. It really didnt take long for me(a part of the audience) to figure out that this was a trans story, not just a femme gay story.  
Sometimes the femme gay man isnt a gay man, that's life and it's how it's gone down for many of my friends, where they thought they were just more femme than other guys.  
  
The signs were all there, you just missed them.  
It's by no means perfect, but I definitely wouldnt call it bad, at the very least it's not as bad as Call Me By Your Name.",,kgwivvr,kgwg4ku,1,2024-01-08 15:08:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15mo2hn/glamorous_on_netflix_a_review/kgwivvr
"> the constant comments on Marcos makeup and how important it is to them, the gradual increase how femme they dressed, did their hair and make up too?

But that's the point.  That's not gender, that's gender expression.  That's the crux of the show - this is a male (gender/gender identity) that dresses femme (gender expression) and is gay (sexuality).  That's what we were told to accept at the onset, and that we'd be seeing a world they live in with those traits.  

To be a story about discovering their gender identity, the audience should be invited to participate.  

If we want to talk about clues along the way and pretend that this was sufficient, then I put the equally plausible story arc forward - before the start of the show Marco won the lottery.  

See, she's secretly a millionaire the entire time and hasn't told her mother.  The clues?  The clothes.  The makeup.  The shoes.  The handbags.  She dresses *rich*.  Like not just clever-with-a-budget, but full-on *wealthy*.  All the clues are there.  So in the final scene she could reveal to her mother that she actually won the lotto and has decided to share it with her mom.  

That final 3 minutes of show could be easily replaced and fit all of the exact same clues.  And would be equally unsatisfying to the audience.  

&#x200B;

The premise of the show tells us to not assume she's trans.  That this is a stereotype that we must avoid.  That she is actually a he that is simply femme.  It would have been super easy to assume that Marco was trans in the first 5 minutes of the show, but purely based on stereotypes and personal biases.  Boy wears girl cloths and makeup?  Must be trans!  The show tells us to reject this and accept femme.  

Only to break that at the end.  ""Nope, you are right!  All your personal biases and stereotypes were bang-on the money!  Boy wears girl clothes = trans!  That's a bingo!""  

That's bad story telling.",,kgwl4o7,kgwivvr,1,2024-01-08 15:22:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/15mo2hn/glamorous_on_netflix_a_review/kgwl4o7
