I looked on Amazons site and here are the instructions on how to get access if 2FA fails as well:


Recover Your Account after Two-Step Verification Fails


If Two-Step Verification fails and you can't access your account, you can try to recover your account.


To regain access to your account, you'll need to verify your identity by providing a scan or photo of a government-issued identity document. To protect your account, we won't be able to make changes to your Two-Step Verification settings until your identity is successfully verified. If you are able to sign in to your account, you'll have access to make changes to your account.


Before you begin account recovery, try to sign in with a registered backup method or from a trusted device.


If you still can't sign in, to recover your account:


Go to Two-Step Verification Account Recovery.


Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your identity document.


Make sure that your name and address, and the issuing authority (for example, state or country) are visible.


Cover, conceal, or remove sensitive information such as account numbers or identification numbers.


The verification process can take 1-2 days to complete. We'll email you to confirm once Two-Step Verification has been disabled. You'll then be able to access your account with only your password.

"Context: I like buying second hand books. One of the biggest market is ofc from amazon 3rd party vendors. I personally like browsing rather than tracking directly a lot of books I would like to read, especially since the market is very 'volatile' and if I see a book a like then go for it.

The issues is amazon is limiting the search even to vendors to 20 pages meaning it's sometimes impossible to browse a vendor's full stock even if going very specific (like for example Science Fiction & Fantasy). After 20 pages basically you get blank results.

"The issue appears to be that The Abyss Special Edition is  a ""FEATURE"" of the Theatrical movie in MoviesAnywhere. Its not a stand alone version for purchase in MoviesAnywhere.  So there is nothing for Amazon or other retailers to link to in the MA catalog when they sell the Special Edition by itself.

Vudu's listing matches the MoviesAnywhere listing.  Special Edition is listed as a feature of the Theatrical.   So it should work properly, where if you buy the Theatrical you get Special Edition as a feature.

To watch the Special Edition this way,  you'll need to use Vudu, MoviesAnywhere or something linked to MA that shows and plays the ""Special Features"" for the movies so you can see, select and watch the Special Edition version of the movie.

"Think of Prime, iTunes, GooglePlay, Vudu, Microsoft, etc.  as digital retailers.  You can buy your movies there.

MoviesAnywhere (aka MA)  is a ""locker"" or ""shelf"" or ""library"" system which can tie all those retailers together for movies from supported studios and will share your eligible purchases among them, so movies purchased from one linked retailer can be played back at another retailer.   More importantly, if the retailer you purchased the movie from shuts down for some reason, you still have the digital copy available to watch on another retailer.

When you buy a movie from Prime or other linked MA capable service, if the movie is eligible for MA, it will ""port""  to your MA library and then be available in all the linked retailers for watching.

NOTE: for this to work there are several pieces that have to be in place.

1. MoviesAnywhere must be available in your country, and you must setup an account there.
2. You must use the account linking feature in MA  to connect the retailers to your MA account.
3. This only works for MA eligible MOVIES, it does not work for TV shows.
4. While Disney, Universal, Sony and Warner Bros work with MA,  Studios like Paramount, Lions Gate, and others do NOT!  So if you buy Mission Impossible (Paramount) or such, they are not MA eligible and will not ""port"" or get shared with other retailers.
5. Even for supported studios, it still may be possible to find a movie that isn't MA eligible.   Best to check the MA web site to be sure, or what I do is check the movie listing at [](http://vudu.com) and scroll to the More Info section (where you see length, release date,etc) and look for the MA/MoviesAnywhere logo. If the logo is there, it will port into your linked MA account.
6. If you disconnect a retailer from your MA account, your shared purchases will eventually be removed from MA.   for example, if I buy 15 movies from Prime, link it to MA, then remove Prime from MA, those 15 movies will be removed from my MA library.",,kd6m91u,kd43vyq,5,2023-12-13 14:35:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/18godd4/the_abyss_4k_is_buggedas_well_as_other_james/kd6m91u

"Sorry, but Aliens has lots of differences in addition to the sentry guns. Goes into Ripley's daughter, shows Newt's family and the colony before the aliens invade. I actually prefer the shorter theatrical version due to it's relentless pace and suspense. And when I saw The Abyss in the theater, the whole audience was let down by an ending that failed to stick the landing on what was an otherwise amazing movie. The special edition absolutely nailed the ending and has tons of little moments and extended scenes that make it far superior to what the studio forced Cameron to release in 1989. Those bean counters really underestimated Cameron's ability to make a movie with massive appeal, and their interference contributed to Cameron's only box office disappointment (other than the flying fish flick).",,ke85djj,kddnb9y,1,2023-12-20 20:12:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/18godd4/the_abyss_4k_is_buggedas_well_as_other_james/ke85djj

"I'm watching on my Roku.  Last winter, I tried to watch the Lord of the Rings tv show and the app could never keep the episodes straight or even tell me what episode it was trying to play.   I gave up.

I have Prime (for the moment) and am trying to watch The Boys but it's happening again. I can't make progress in season 2 because it won't let me rewatch episodes it thinks I'm done with.

Once again, if I have to back up and rewatch and episode:

1. it doesn't give me the option at first - it automatically plays from latest episode watched
2. even if I back out and specifically pick the episode I want, 50% of time it plays the latest episode regardless
3. when I do play the right episode, if i press pause, then resume, IT SWITCHES AND CONTINUES FROM THE LATEST EPISODE ANYWAY.  That's right- it changes episodes surreptitiously
4. the episode list will be reordered at random  (sometimes with wrong thumbnails)
5. stops displaying season/episode/title when player is paused.  This makes it impossible to verify what the app is doing

How am I supposed to watch this show?   It's impossible.

Stupid problems like this are a real pattern with Amazon's apps  (all three that I've tried).   It's like the developers only bother with one simplistic use case and abandon all the others to fail.   The results are pushed onto customer service, whose scripts do not include getting problems fixed.

"I wanted to buy 2 cards with codes for in game currency on prime day because they were discounted

I first ordered using a card that was NOT in euro, my money didnt get taken and I though, okay I need to use revolut to pay with euro.
So i transfered money on revolut and I didnt get charged again. I though this didnt work again so I tried a few more times with making new cards, trying to use the revolut bank account instead of the card but nothing so I contacted support. They told me it takes up to 4 hours for confirmations(didnt know, dont have amazon in my country so it was my first order). So after 4 hours I get my 2 codes worth 120 euros, a lot of mesages that the payment didnt go through(because i only had 120 euro)  AND AN EXTRA 2 CODES.

Today I got a message being asked to pay for the extra codes but I didnt want them(they are non refundable) and I think its amazon's fault for giving me something for free, then asking for the money(something definetly went wrong, they shouldn't send me anything when the payment fails) .

"Anyone know the fix to the recurring issue I have where the Prime Video app on my iPad won’t let me change profiles? It happens maybe half the time when I open the app. It worked fine for years where I would press the button in the top right to switch profiles. Now, it usually doesn’t give me the option. It is particularly annoying when stuck in my daughter’s kid profile, which is usually where the issue happens. It got stuck in my profile maybe once or twice.

"When opening a return for an item, there were multiple options available, including dropping off at my local UPS with no packaging/box (or with packaging/box). I selected no packaging because that would be the easiest way for me to return the items.

Looking at the shipping label, it says packaging necessary and mentions it under the instructions for returning the item.

This happened with a previous return last month. Same scenario, where I selected the option for no packaging to my local UPS, but when I went to return the item, packaging was necessary. I had to go back home, package, and then drop off at the UPS store.

Is this a bug on the website? Why would they offer the option to drop off the item with no packaging/box, but then the shipping label would require packaging/box. There is another separate option in that list for dropping off the item with box/packaging to my local UPS store as well.","When returning item, selected no packaging to a local UPS store, but shipping label ended up saying packaging necessary.

Everything I try to order says ""1-2 days Once shipped"" So basically everything i order doesn't get shipped for 4-6 days. 

My room mate who also is a prime member doesn't have this problem ordering the same exact item and have even had him order me something because he gets packages on time. My neighbor doesn't have  this problem and we're in an apartment building. I made a brand new amazon account and it has estimated shipping delivery dates no problem.

I've spent a couple hours over multiple days trying to call amazon to figure out what's going on and pretty much they just keep transferring around to different departments until they someone hangs up on me or they tell me its a driver issue.

I've had this prime account for like 10 years and I have TONS of purchased things, movies and use their photo backup. Transferring to a new account would be a huge hassle and probably isn't even possible.

I don't know what to do or what department to try to get in touch with to fix this.

2. Looked at the email address to see if it looked suspect. It did not as it had the @ amazon.com postfix.
3. Checked the email address via google and put in ""scam"" afterward and immediately found this page on Reddit.
4. Checked my Amazon account to see if anything was charge fraduletly. Nothing was.
5. Checked my Amazon messages and confirmed it was indeed sent via [amazon.com](https://amazon.com).
6. Whether it was a fraud or mistake by Amazon (if it was Amazon then I'm sure we'll get a follow up email tomorrow morning) was assured everything was ok.

When I told him I had already verified the links were for the legit Amazon site, and that I could see them in my account's messages (from Amazon's message center, he didn't know what to say) I advised the guy to get with a manager and revise the excuse.

If the emails have been sent out in error, then they need to tell people. I’ve just spent 2 hours trying to sort out if this is a problem or not, including taking action such as securing other accounts just in case.

Even if it was legit fraud, the messaging is appalling. The support amounts to … if you don’t see it I. Your orders don’t worry about it. This is great, except for when you use multiple Amazon stores and they error displaying your order details…. And the chat is useless, just sending you to a useless process to validate the email is real (guess what it looks like it!!) and then no way to handle if it is real.

I also can add to the confirmation that it’s just a glitch. I spent about a half hour waiting for CS since they have been inundated with calls concerning this very issue. The representative was very reassuring that the IT team has been contacted and is working on the reason for the email blast. Most importantly I was told that there were absolutely no gift card purchases made from my account, and if there were to be any in a worst case type scenario that the money would be refunded in full (although that is both a worrisome and comforting statement).

Amazon was aware of the issue the second it happened and customers started calling and initiating chats with customer service in a panic. Yet your customer service representatives would not acknowledge that Amazon made a mistake, and instead kept rattling off excuse after excuse. I wasted hours of my time on the phone and on chat with different entities, cancelling cards, changing passwords, and checking transactions, all because Amazon made a mistake and couldn't just admit it.

I can’t seem to find anything suggesting that I have been charged for these alleged gift card purchases they say I made. I am guessing someone at Amazon just screwed up bigtime. My guess is that getting through to Amazon will be useless; the reps will have replies on this that are all over the place, because they’ll have no clue what is happening. For me this was especially jarring because I almost never use Amazon Pay on an outside website, and just today I did use it to shop from a small store, so I was scared my info had been stolen somehow via that transaction.

I have been told by Amazon support that they are taking my formal complaint down and request my mother (who is the main/hub of our Amazon Prime Family) ""email us to cs-reply@amazon.com"" to lodge a formal complaint so it is taken seriously.  I have also been advised by Amazon CS to let everyone with a problem with this new policy (ad-free not sharing on family sharing and/or not being informed it will not share with the family when paying for ad-free) to send them an email.  May I suggest a variation on or a copy/paste of the following?  


  
To whom it may concern,

I would like to lodge a formal complaint about the new ad-free subscription add-on to Amazon Prime.  It does not share on Family Sharing in Amazon Household.  It should.  We are only allowed one other adult account attached to our main Amazon Prime subscription.  Other services allow us multiple profiles on a single account to differentiate between users (preferences, watchlists, etc), while yours does not.

Same with Netflix and Disney+. (Which the later is now a webapp using Microsoft Edge but without it's UI for some reason, it used to be it's own actual app based on the one found on Xbox but ported to Windows)

It has just been accepted as part of the service, not seen as an ad, like a trailer that's playing at the cinema before the actual movie. 

The reason I think that is because ads for one of Amazon's own shows at the very beginning of a show have been around for a long time and it's got nothing to do with the ads introduction that's happening at the moment. What does something have to do with the ads introduction is the awareness of anything hat could be seen as an advertisement, such as those trailers playing at the beginning of shows.

To whom it may concern,

I would like to lodge a formal complaint about the new ad-free subscription add-on to Amazon Prime.  It does not share on Family Sharing in Amazon Household.  It should.  We are only allowed one other adult account attached to our main Amazon Prime subscription.  Other services allow us multiple profiles on a single account to differentiate between users (preferences, watchlists, etc), while yours does not.  

It also does not inform you when paying for the ad-free subscription add-on that it will not share with Family Sharing.  It should.

"For anyone still wondering about this, I think I have figured it out.

Amazon Profiles & Accounts are different. If you signed up independently to Amazon, then you have an independent account.

Even if accounts are linked through the ""Household"", they are still independent accounts. This means that ad free does not work on both, because they are not just profiles. Likewise, if you purchase a movie or show on one account, it is not shared with other accounts in the Household.

To get ad free, you would have to sign in with the same account that purchased the ad free subscription, then select your profile.

If you don't want to sign in with the same account, I think you're shit out of luck unless Amazon changes the policy.",,kpsfol0,1aeexzw,2,2024-02-10 15:16:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1aeexzw/amazon_household_not_sharing_new_adfree_purchase/kpsfol0

Profiles and Household accounts are completely different. You can add a profile in Prime Video for anything. It’s just a name on the screen and viewing history. It’s not linked to a real person. You can make a profile for your dog. Household accounts are other people with their own independent Amazon accounts that you’re sharing your Prime benefits with. They can watch Prime Video under a profile created for them, under the same one you use, or under the one you created for your dog.

"We do have to make 2 contact attempts before marking a package unable to deliver without it affecting our metrics. That's why the call and text. But they did not mark it. Usually that means that it will be re-attempted at the end of the route...... except that all the DSP drivers have today off. It must have been a Flex driver (the gig workers who deliver in their personal vehicles).
 
Unfortunately, many of them will not return a package at then of a flex block. They will simply wait until their next block, whenever that may be.... it could be a couple days in some cases. They don't really care that you are waiting for it, they don't want to drive back to the station to drop it off. So it may or may not go back out for delivery again tomorrow...... but it will be sent back out.
Amazon usually sends a package out 3 times for delivery before the order gets canceled.

"Few weels ago they ran some killer deals on generators,  we ordered a westinghouse unit that typically goes for 900 to 1000 at a big box store for $350.

Generator shows up the next week i wasnt home so i inspected and opened it later that night.  Upon opening it i see black soot all over the box, get the thing out of the box and looks like the carbon filter cracked, relatively simple part to repair rest of unit looks fine.

I get online with customer support and just say it shipped damage id like a replacement unit or the damaged component replaced (amazon sells the carbon filter).   Guy says he cant do a refunds, cant repair, can give me a discount on another generator.  I say I'm not happy go back and forth and within 5 minutes he says fine I'll refund you but you'll have to ""dispose"" of the damaged generator on your own dime.  I act angry but in reality i just won, account was credited 4 days later.

I go on westinghouses website customer support submit a claim for unit shipped damaged, need part xyz shipped to me.  Email reaponse 30 minutes later saying its on its way.  Plug in the new filter and generator runs flawlessly. 

Amazon could have solved my issue with the OEM or their own inventory for <$10 but instead gave away the whole generator and shipping cost.  I really wonder how these inefficiencies cost them?

"I had this twice with third party Chinese sellers who don't want to spend money on return shipping. Once it was a stationary exercise bike that I couldn't put together. One of the pedals didn't attach no matter how much I tried. They asked for videos of me attempting to assemble it. I sent them a video of one pedal tightening correctly, and the other not working. They said they will ship a second bike, no need to return. Second one had the same problem so I thought to Google it. Apparently you have to tighten one of the pedals to the left, not the right. Which makes sense I guess, but I had no prior experience. The instructions didn't say this, either, and the reps who watched my video of me doing righty-tighty on both sides also didn't correct me. The bike was cheap though, $130. Now we had 2, for more than one family member to exercise together.

Another time it was a couch that was sooo badly made. The lining on the back was polypropylene (the material that some reusable bags use, like Target - rips super easily). I put a finger through it just taking the couch out of the box. My cat walked over the open box and snagged and ripped several threads before I even took the couch out. It took years of scratching for my cat to cause any damage to my previous couch. And it was so uncomfortable! I tried to return. They tried to offer some % discount if I kept it. I said no, I want to return. They just refunded me. It wasn't much of a win because it was a really bad couch.

"$350 is not ""big ticket"". That would be something like a computer or phone that costs $1500-2000+.

I never had anything like that but Amazon used to be great about stuff like this. I got a used $2000 camera once (over 1,000 shutter count), returned it (they sent out the exchange one NEXT DAY before even getting the first one back), but it also was used, although just a little (50 shutter count), so they gave me a $400 gift card on the used one since I bought it at new price and I kept it.

I don't even want to know how bad it would be now if I had to solve the used camera issue, which happened to me in 2016 when I consider Amazon to have been at their peak.",,kflafqp,18ulg63,-4,2023-12-30 19:10:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/18ulg63/anyone_else_ever_have_it_this_easy_on_a_big/kflafqp

"All of those ‘costs’ they just ram down the throats of the Amazon seller. Amazon sellers have to take it because if a manufacturer or distributor doesn’t sell directly on Amazon then someone else in their channel will go around them and sell on Amazon anyway and screw up the brand etc. etc. 

Amazon is a great example of winner take all producing a monopoly.

"I usually request Amazon credit for my returns because it appears in my account immediately, vs having to wait for it to show up in my bank, and having to remember to check for it. Though expensive items, I choose bank because of the horror stories of accounts getting banned with a lot of credit in them.

Additionally, I'm suspicious of how they handle refunds for items bought with gift card or any other unconventional method like points. Let's say I buy an item and pay for it partially or totally with Amazon credit I received from another return. Then I return it and select original payment method, or Amazon credit. Will both options credit me correctly?

I've come across issues with returns of items that I used credit card points towards. I get notified that my refund was processed but I don't see it in my gift card credit or my bank. CS tells me I got my points credited back, but I don't know how to check it. It's way too much for me to keep track of. First I have to check the payment method, which isn't clear if I bought several items in an order. Let's say I bought 5 items totaling $70, of which $20 was credit card points. Then I return a $25 item from the order, and they can totally not refund me at all, and it will be impossible to verify.

It's already happened to me with the ""slower shipping"" credits for digital item. I accidentally bought an e-book I already had, returned it immediately, but did not get my money back. They said they don't credit digital credit returns, which is sucky. They just confirm that they sent your refund, but you don't get anything.",,kfnaujj,kfm5xjq,3,2023-12-31 02:54:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/18ulg63/anyone_else_ever_have_it_this_easy_on_a_big/kfnaujj

"I learned a new word from somebody about Prime.
Randomly, as in removes it.
I've noticed it with several things I either started or put on my watchlist.
I watched a movie that has sequels 3 to be exact, watched 2.
Next day less than 24 hrs later, all 3 were buy or rent.
I've also seen this happen with seasons had all of em when I put on watchlist,, go to watch 123 missing season 4 but have the rest.
Apparently as someone on here said Prime has stuff x amount of time and episodes of shows that are missing is because whoever has them hasn't released.
And times true maybe.
I thought I was just not seeing that some show you have to buy certain ones after.
And series I just didn't see that episode 4 was missing when I first put on my list.
So I started paying attention and take screenshots, I was really starting to think it was me it isn't,
So random has nothing to do with the fact that hey know I watched all but last one.
And all seasons present till I get to that certain one that they know you want.
So why does Prime buy seasons where the middle is missing.
I'm just not gonna pay to watch the 3rd sequel.

"Myself and my best friend are in an Amazon Household (which is basically my acocunt I pay for - sometimes we want to watch stuff at the same time, but he won't pay for Prime so I thought Household is an easy way to give him access).

It works fine except for one thing. I subscribe to Shudder as a channel inside Prime Video. But he can't access that - if he searches for a show or film, or if I send him the direct link to them - he's given the option to either buy them outright or subscribe to Shudder too.

I assumed the channels would be shared given they have access to everything else. Does anyone know if this is a bug, or if I need to enable sharing of channels somewhere?

Good deal... except I noted now WD sells it for 229.today also. so either they are price matching or ssd price is going down permanently timed with sale this week.

Amazon will list the release MSRP as a normal price, so tells me this 20% off is 67% off, but it's been a long time since that drive was $600

I thought this sort of scam sales were illegal already? Maybe it is just in my state. Businesses got sued for artificially raising the prices right before the sale to actually make them the same as regular price during the sale. Or listing percentage mark offs from prices the product never actually sold at by that company/business within a certain amount of days. Like they can only show the percentage off from the highest price sold in the 30days leading up to the sale by them and not a “retail price” that they never sold it for even prior to the so called sale. It can’t be called a sale price if it’s almost the same as the store’s everyday selling price. Budget types of stores would be notorious for these bogus sales…they would show percentages off from the retail price that it never was sold for at to begin with. Sometimes they would raise the prices the week before a big advertised sale that would bring in numbers of people who don’t typically shop at that store and with the “sale price” sometimes the items were actually more expensive than when it wasn’t on sale. Since a large number of the shoppers didn’t usually shop there and was only there for the sale no one really noticed the scam. It went on for years until people started noticing or employees started blowing whistles and then the laws I mentioned above were made. It’s all part of consumer protection from shady business practices.,,jrmlzyd,jrieivw,1,2023-07-12 05:04:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/14wjzuh/this_has_to_be_a_joke/jrmlzyd

">... sacrifice morals

And basic standards. There's no reason why Amazon should be dipping this low unless something internal has gone very wrong for them. For instance, importing all goods from China, no quality assurance, and much more.

Notice how Apple is doing great. Apple doesn't sacrifice its standards for a dollar. In this way, Apple maintains marketshare because customers trust Apple (even when they occasionally mess up).

In contrast, customer trust with Amazon is eroding, fast. Signing people up for subscriptions they don't want on Prime Video, and then making it super difficult to discover, cancel and get a refund. Constantly selling fake items, and denying customer returns for empty packages and fraudulent items. Tricking people into signing up for Prime. Tricking people into paying more for shipping than is required. Making customers pay for returns. Increasing the price of Music services don't work correctly, where the catalog of songs is less than promoted. FireTV and Alexa pushing bloatware to get you to delete apps that Amazon doesn't own (i.e., direct competitors to Prime Video) and buy new devices. Employees spying on people using Ring and Alexa app, and violating child protection by making profiles of kids that parents don't know about and can't delete. The list goes on.

What happened to Amazon? Who is actually in charge? Is this the intended outcome? This is not great. Just like Twitter, customers are moving on. Who's plan is it to react by nickel and diming customers on their way out? Just do better already. Amazon ruined the supply chain. Take a loss in the short term to increase quality for the long term. Fire the management who are driving these horrible decisions. Insist on standards.

I have been using AMZ prime for many many years. Lately, I've gotten some doggy looking products when ordering from AMZ, which I immediately returned. However, it triggered a thought. When  items are returned do they check what's actually been returned? For  example I bought a higher end blender one time that seemed that it was  used and not the same model, but the same brand as the packaging. It was packed  up like new and everything, but anyone can open a box and take stuff out and put stuff back. Does anyone check what customers are  returning before reselling it? Are things re-sold if they're returned or do they go somewhere else and this was some sort of anomaly?

I hate this feature. I tried the Amazon Day deliveries multiple times. Every time, the package has become lost during shipping. And then they won’t refund you until after two days.

"I am a long time Prime member in SW Floriduh{multiple warehouse locations in area-perspective}. Last week, 9/29/23, I was ordering stainless steel washers in a 100 count pack that I needed asap. The item page said ""Prime One Day"" and the next line said ""FREE delivery Tomorrow"", but when I put 2 packs of the washers in the the cart and proceeded to ""Check out"" then the delivery time was extended with no option for 1 day. This has happened before in the past. So what I did was change the order to 1 item of 100 count washers @ $13.79 and the one day shipping appeared so I placed the order. Then I immediately ordered another pack and again the one day shipping was an option. When I went to place the order the system let me know this was a duplicate order and asked if I still wanted to place it and I said yes. Both packs arrived the next day in separate thin plastic envelopes.

On the same day I placed a separate order for small individual stacking drawers @ $13.99 each. Again it said one day delivery but there were only 5 left and I did not want to play the individual order game so I just ordered 5 and delivery is suppose to happen Oct 2-3. I saw the item was restocked to 15 the next day or two. I noticed today 10/1/23 at 9 P.M. the order still has not shipped, so I went back to the item page to double check the shipping times and this time only 7 drawers left in stock, and again it says 1 day delivery, so I put 5 in the cart and in checkout it is saying delivery between Oct 5-Oct 12. 

I called Amazon customer service, who could see the items in my cart, and asked why this happens and the agent did not know. If it is because the items had to come from separate warehouses, with one being out of town, then why did the washers both get here the next day as did other orders I have placed this way? I am going to assume the system has been programed to make it so if more than one of the same item is ordered it automatically allows for a longer shipping time to accommodate items coming from different warehouses, but who on this planet knows for sure? Maybe a total of one person at Amazon corporate? All I know is, if I need something in a hurry that the local stores don't stock I will order one item at a time to get the free""Prime One Day"" delivery.",,k3376hd,1336js8,1,2023-10-02 03:25:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1336js8/before_i_buy_itll_say_it_can_be_delivered/k3376hd

"Happens in every other order.  Even though I changed it back instead of Amazon delivery day.  It's so annoying.  I went to purchase something for my classroom and needed it quickly.  I saw it would be delivered in time before I purchased it.  As soon as I bought the item, the date changed.  It said it would be delivered in 2 days.  I even made sure to select that option.  As soon as I clicked confirm purchase, it switched to 4 days away.  I don't really mind it unless I actually need the item in a certain period of time.  If I had known they would change the delivery date, I would have just gone to Walmart.  I think they just hope no one will know and it's a marketing ploy to make sales.  I miss the days 2-day shipping was actually 2-day shipping.  Now it says 2-day shipping but tends to be 3 or 4 in reality.  Makes it even worse because we are paying for that perk.",,k654owy,1336js8,1,2023-10-23 19:52:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1336js8/before_i_buy_itll_say_it_can_be_delivered/k654owy
"I constantly struggle with delivery times from Amazon.  Between my wife and I we probably have Amazon stop at our house 3-4x a week.  I get a lot of stuff from Amazon because I have a small business which I manufacture some products.

Anyway, sometimes things will say they will be delivered the next day, but it never happens.  Almost everything I get takes at least 1 to 2 days longer to be delivered, and I get the ""package is running late"" or ""there was a problem"" all the time.  Items that originally said one day, can come in a week or more.  

But, most of the time, packages are delivered one day later that what the order info says.  And this is with Amazon delivery.  Packages delivered by a 3rd party have a bigger delivery window, and they almost always arrive in that window.",,k7nbghh,1336js8,1,2023-11-03 13:25:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1336js8/before_i_buy_itll_say_it_can_be_delivered/k7nbghh

"I HAVE A SOLUTION! I just dealt with this yesterday but I fixed their wagon!  I´ve been a Prime member for years and just got sick and tired of the ´bait and switch´ delivery dates.  Whether it´s same day delivery, next day delivery or two day delivery.  As soon as I place my order 9 times out of 10, that date changes to a later one as soon as I check out.  SO, I decided to deal with them once and for all.  

I started with the chat option.  The agent flat out lied to me and told me that I definitely would receive my items that day just to get rid of me...this was not the first time an agent mislead me so I was prepared.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and when one came on, they immediately told me the same thing.  Now, keep in mind that I'm looking at my order summary page as I'm chatting.  As soon as they went to their default of ´you´ll be receiving it today´ I asked them if they had fairies working for them.  Why? Because I had clicked on the updates and my items weren't even out for delivery!  So, it must be magic, right?

When they couldn't  provide me with answer, I told them I wanted a call from another supervisor BUT that I would not be disconnecting until I had one on the phone.  A supervisor called and I closed out the chat.  Then, I was as deceptive and they are and I´m not ashamed of it.  I told them that as a small business owner and they were costing me money since I had to cancel appointments based on the fact that I didn't have the supplies I needed.  As soon as the words came out of my mouth, the delivery date changed to that day with a time window for delivery.  I asked them how that was possible since I knew my items weren't even on the carrier´s truck!  They told me the had NO idea how that happened.  Another lie 😡 so, I kept to my story.

Of course, they asked me how I could possibly know this. That's when my deception played a part.  I told them that I had a contact at the carrier and had already been told that my items were not on the day´s truck for delivery.  Silence! 🤣 Then they offered me a credit on an Amazon gift card. LOL!  I told them that no way in hell would I accept that since it simply guaranteed them another sale.  I insisted I get a refund to my original payment method AND, that the measly amount they offered me was an insult.  They agreed to reimburse me for 6 months of my yearly Amazon Prime subscription.  

However, I let them know that since they've been making it a habit of lying to their customers I didn't trust them and would not hang up until the refund was processed.  They went into ´default´ mode again and said it would take 5 to 10 days for my financial institution to process...blah, blah, blah.  So, I told them what they were going to do...they were going to send me an email stating what they were telling me on the phone.  They tried to be slick and agreed to send it as soon as they were through with the call.  Yeah, right!  I informed them that I would not be hanging up until their email came through.

Once I had the email, I let them have it...politely.  I told them that I understood they weren't personally responsible for the issue BUT that I knew Amazon trained them to be deceptive and that I didn't appreciate them insulting my intelligence.  I ended the call.

Boom!  My UPS delivery person, who I know well, arrived a couple of hours later with my packages so I asked them how my items got on their truck when they weren't there at the beginning of their route and they told me that they got a call from their higher up and told to come back to the warehouse to pick up items that needed to be delivered THAT day.

IF I didn't rely on the other perks of Prime, I would have canceled it that very minute!  However, I found a way around that too.  I googled how to download the books I purchased via Audible, how to download the songs on my playlist from Amazon music and although it requires the downloading of a program that converts their format to one I can save to my laptop and listen to via my Echo, it is worth its price in gold....or in this case, worth more than what I pay for Prime.

I´m not a deceptive person by nature, but when it comes to my money I don´t play around. I'm  in the process of downloading my digital content and once I'm done it's goodbye Amazon Prime!

I´m no in any way encouraging anyone to resort to my tactic but, if you stick to your guns and learn the rules to their game, you have a much better chance of receiving your items when it states and not a minute later.  My advice? As soon as you place your order, hop on a chat with an agent.  Ask for a supervisor.  Tell them you will not put up with a date change.  If they can´t make it happen, ask to be compensated for their deceptive practices.  Chances are you´ll at least get something from them for your trouble.

Apologies for the very long post but I hope it helps someone else dealing with Bezos´Amazon.",,kiwyvs9,1336js8,1,2024-01-21 17:46:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1336js8/before_i_buy_itll_say_it_can_be_delivered/kiwyvs9

"I suggest you re-read this page. The issue is that the item specifically says it is available by Wednesday (for example) and this is reiterated on the delivery section of the checkout system. This is confirmed by choosing this day or even making Wednesday the Amazon Prime delivery day. Then, after payment, said item has Thursday delivery marked next to it (if not much worse). This may affect 1 or 2 items out of a bundle of 3 (for example). Thus, the recipient has to wait in on two days for the separate packages (and it could  be more days for more items.) This is esp. galling if the items are intended as part of a single gift, as it may mean asking someone to remain at home on two days if the items are unlikely to be safely delivered in their absence. This is made worse when, after the initial purchase, the item is still being sold as available on the original date, even if ordered up to a few hours before Wednesday. Thus, they claim they can (still) deliver to some people on the original date but not to me, even though my purchase is hours earlier. If the delivery date can only be calculated at time of shipping then they should say something like ""Allow x to y days for delivery"". Amazon specifically do not do this. They consistently offer a specific date (and to Prime Customers, esp. the facility of choosing a Prime Date or an Amazon Delivery Day) and yet they regularly remove that choice. That is what we were complaining about. If there was a message at checkout saying ""If you complete this order within the next x minutes this item will arrive between Wednesday and Friday"" (for example) there would be fewer complaints. It is the fact that they appear to be offering assurances up to delivery, which they continue to offer to others, but which they withdraw from actual purchasers. They treat their delivery dates as if they are advertising and not part of the actual sale.",,kcz1pfv,ji9irhz,1,2023-12-12 00:49:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1336js8/before_i_buy_itll_say_it_can_be_delivered/kcz1pfv

">There have been times where the countdown timer will say delivery by X date   
>  
>if you order within the next 22 hours and X minutes  
>  
> and then a few minutes later (literally, I’m talking within five minutes here) change to a delivery date that’s two, sometimes three days after the previously stated date. It’s happened before if I’ve selected a different color or size option on the same product page but then go back to the original one, so it’s not a matter of leaving the page.

Leaving the page has no impact on the item availability. Until you checkout and payment is made and or  a hold is placed on the card, nothing is reserved. For many fast moving items customers don't fully realize how fast things can sell. There are hundreds of thousands of other potential buyers that are also on the site at the same time and if that product is hot it can sell thousands of units in minutes.

&#x200B;

>I understand that other factors such as changes in inventory or delivery capacity, as you mentioned above, can render the delivery date unavailable but it’s pretty extreme for the timer to say I have almost a full day to place the order if I want it by X day to then marking the date two or three days out (not even the following day!) all within the span of a few minutes.

"This has been bugging me for some time now because it didn't use to be this way. 

Though a prime video tv show is displayed in the Continue Watching section of my firestick home screen, I cannot play the next episode from there. I'm told that it is ""...currently unavailable"". However, I am able to play the episode if I go into the Prime Video app. 

What is the point of displaying the things I can continue watching on the home screen if I can't access it from there? Seems like something is broken. I don't know if it's me or something that changed with Prime Video or the firestick UI. I've checked all the settings I can think of.

"Amazon tech support and launch team is scrambling like mad and cannot predict a completion timeline to fix the problem for customers who upgrade to no ads and yet are forced to still watch ads while they fix the problem.

Apparently we upgraded very early and got caught in this quite large bug situation. It does work properly with no ads on the website and on mobile apps but if you're streaming to a TV yeah probably out of luck.

I was on the phone with Amazon support twice totaling 53min and initially they told me it would be fixed in 4 to 5 minutes, but put me on eternal hold and dropped the call. The second call I lucked into someone who was so shocked by what was going on she spilled the tea without realizing.

She said the development team was in a mad frantic scramble trying to find and fix the problem and that customer service lines were dropping calls off after 20min on hold. She said everybody in the tech arena was working overtime until further notice and that they would be releasing an email to all affected Prime Video subscribers. I feel sorry for them and the wrath they will endure from Bezos.

I asked multiple times if she had any inkling when it would be fixed, an hour, a day, 3 days, a week? She said their words were, ""We just don't know, tell them we'll explain by email.""

When I asked if we had made the upgrade through the affected TV rather than through the website if it would have made a difference she said, ""No, it doesn't appear to matter which portal was used to upgrade to ads-free.""

"I ordered a box of trash bags from Amazon. The trash bags are sold by Sam's Club. One day after placing the order, I came home to find the box of trash bags sitting at the front door. No shipping label, no address label, nothing. It was like they were plucked from the store and placed onto my porch. I checked our front door camera and it looked like a younger person (teenager or young adult) - he dropped the box off, did something on his phone, waved at the camera, and left.

One day after the trash bags were ""delivered,"" I got a notification that the same item shipped. The next day, it was marked as delivered and signed for by someone not at my address. BTW, where I am located, we are too rural for two-day shipping. It's usually 5-7 days. So this lead time was already way expedited outside of normalcy.

I reached out to Amazon and they said their team was investigating. Then they issued a gift card totaling the amount of my order. Not what I asked for.. but okay.

I can't figure out the scheme/scam here. How could UPS mark something as delivered with a signature when they know damn well there's no box? Who's in cahoots?! What's the end game? Saved monies on shipping?

"This happened in 2020, but it still bugs me and I can’t figure out why. During Covid I began receiving random crap I don’t order. A cheaply made HUGE dog bed. Some weird tech simulator thing. A crappy beard clipper. I checked my Amazon account, but didn’t see orders for these items. Then I thought to check my Amex statement and realized there were close to $500 worth of Amazon charges over the course of two months that I couldn’t square with my known purchases. Most were these weird random items but some were digital purchases. 

I connected with Amazon service over the phone and using one of the item numbers on the shipping label he was able to locate a cloned account with a different email but my name and address and the weird merchandise that had been shipped to me. I told them I didn’t want the merchandise and wanted them to refund the money to my card, but they refused because they said I had to go through the other account to request a refund. Except I didn’t make the account and didn’t have the login information. I asked them to shut down the fraudulent account but they also refused. So I called Amex and had my card closed and asked for charge backs on those items, but after review they refused to do the chargebacks because Amazon said I’d ordered the items under my own name and would have to return them if I wanted my money back. I went in circles for weeks until just deciding to eat the money. 

What was the point of the scammer sending my products I didn’t want? Why not just buy what you want and send it to yourself? Can someone explain this to me?

Amazon: it looks like your card is associated with a account you don't own and we can see its fraudulent.

Me: ok, cancel the account and remove my card.

Amazon: sorry, but because you don't own the account your card is on being charged, we can't cancel or remove it.

Me: so just to understand, my card(s) are being used by a account that is not mine, you are saying it is fraudulent and the account is fraud but you won't remove my card(s) or cancel the account because I am not the owner.

Amazon: that is correct, you can ask your bank for the money back and ask them to take care of you, we won't remove your card(s) from a account you didn't authorize.  Thank you for being a valued Prime member.

"I swear I feel like I'm going crazy, I can't find anything else online about this problem.

I've been watching House MD for the second time and I've noticed a bunch of times, certain audio will be straight up missing. Usually these missing audio clips will be two or three words, making it hard to tell if the subtitles are the ones that are wrong or not. I was brushing it off as just my imagination, or that the person transcribing subtitles was adding flourish to the sentences. It doesn't help that the subtitles occasionally are ""incorrect"" in that they convey the same meaning as a spoken phrase but don't match up word for word. Enough reasonable doubt was instilled into my mind that whenever I would notice a phrase missing I would chalk it up to the subtitles being wrong, not the audio. 

However in Episode 13 of Season 3, at around 10:30, Foreman is supposed to say ""I get it, but right now..."" and he does not. The subtitles are correct, and you can see the actor's mouth move, but what is played is ""...But right now..."" completely omitting the ""I get it."" All the audio that is played is still in sync with the video, it's like someone just muted Foreman's mic for a second or two. It's also not an audio bug or a headphone problem, as replaying does not clear it up, and the background music and noise in the show does not cut out. I've no clue why someone would do this to the show. Bad edit job? But why are we randomly editing out dialogue?

It's not a major issue, but I find it really strange, and it happens enough to be slightly distracting. Both audio sources have the issue- English and English with audio description. Can anyone else test to see if the audio works for them, or if this is a problem on their side of things?",Am I going Crazy? - Amazon Video not playing all audio.,13bfve6,0,2,2023-05-08 07:09:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13bfve6/am_i_going_crazy_amazon_video_not_playing_all/

"Aside from social media that I still think is the dominant part of our culture, streaming is the far second. 

Companies have been trying to find the formula to get the most subscribers for that monthly fee. Here are some things I've noticed since I started using these services around 2015. 

\- Original content doesn't sell in most cases. Offer a rich nostalgia library and THEN consumers will bother to look at the original content. Remember, people are narrow and fearful. They won't try something new unless they feel safe. Offer them something familiar first.

\- Fix the bugs. Wait times on videos that get stuck is just amateur hour.

\- If you're going to offer a show, just do the whole series and not like a season. This is a more minor thing though. Not a deal breaker.

\- Take advantage of social media because the one case where a new show will be an attraction is the buzz. Succession is a good example. 

Now onto the five streaming services I've used.

Netflix

I started with this one back in the day. It's got good stuff A decent library. It just lacks the kind of stuff I'm interested in plus some the original documentaries feel a tad political.

Disney Plus

If I was younger I would've loved this, but it was fun for a few months until I got bored because I'm an adult.

Crave

Decent library for an older audience. Just wanted something more.

Apple TV

Worst one I got. Had it for a week. Terrible library and almost solely original content. A lesson in what not to do.

Amazon Prime Video

"Cancelled my prime membership today for various reasons, but I am frankly disgusted with the direction Amazon has taken their business in the past few years. I have been a prime member since 2014, which is almost a decade, so I have a lot of experience with it. I've made thousands of purchases, most of which were great, but the past few years several things have reached the level of unacceptable and I just cancelled my prime service today.

here's what has been bugging me:

More and more items are taking over a week to deliver, despite being prime. I live in a populated city in Canada with a population of a million people, and there is an Amazon warehouse right outside the city. A few years ago when the warehouse was built, Amazon actually started moving towards having more one day guaranteed delivery items, which gave me hope for the future, but somehow things have gotten worse since the warehouse was built. These days when I buy an item, it usually takes 4-5 days to deliver, sometimes a week, even if it is a legit Prime and not a ""fulfilled by amazon"". A few years ago they also started offering ""free delivery for prime members"" items, rather than outright prime items, which as you know are items that aren't really prime, and are actually sold by a third party. I am not talking about these items, I am talking about actual prime items. (although I will add that it is a little annoying that Amazon doesn't have a way to filter \*actual\* prime items from these ""free delivery for prime members"" items when you search.

Delivery dates on prime items are dishonest on the website, and feel like a bait and switch a lot of the time. You can see this for yourself on many items. Perfect example is one that happened to me today. I'm looking for a certain item and before i actually put in my cart, it says that it will be delivered by ""Tuesday March 7"". However, when you go through the checkout, the earliest shipping option you can choose is ""Wednesday March 8"". It really seems like they want to paint a prettier picture about the delivery date before you decide to buy an item, then as you are actually buying it, they do a sleight of hand trick and suddenly change it. Even if you go back and refresh the listing, it still clearly says ""Tuesday March 7"", it even has the count down of ""if you order in the next 6 hours and 32 minutes"", but in the actual check out, they add a day. And on top of that, this date can actually change even after you mutter under your breath and begrudgingly agree to buy it. This exact thing happened today, which was actually the straw that finally pushed me to cancel prime. I ordered this item, listing said Tuesday March 7, checkout said earliest is Wednesday March 8. I agreed to buy it. I check the orders page an hour later, and my delivery date was changed from March 8 to ""March 28 - April 1"". WTF. I guess the item isn't actually in stock or something? I go back to the listing, and it's still being advertised as ""get it Tuesday March 7"". This incident in particular made me wonder how they can be doing this at all, and what am I even paying for? It's bad enough that prime items went from being delivered in two days to three days, to four, to five, and the fact that they are now being very deceptive about the delivery dates, but adding a whole month to a two day purchase? I feel like I am going crazy. Maybe this was an extreme case, but I just feel completely disrespected by this type of thing, it just feels like they are treating me like a sucker, and it kind of feels like some kind of cheap bait and switch parlor trick.

Customer service has gotten more and more stingy, to the point where now, they have removed almost any possible way for you to contact customer service. Everything is automated options that give you certain options and that's it. Most recently I received a used item, which is clearly used by a previous owner - it's opened, and damaged inside, parts are missing. However this item is not available anymore, so my only option is to return it or to exchange it for a different item. But the thing is, this item is hard to find, and I would actually gladly keep it if they offered me a partial refund. I just feel like a sucker paying full price for a used and damaged item, so I kind of have to either give up on the idea of owning it altogether, or just live with being ripped off. Partial refund is not an option anymore apparently.

I keep getting items that are broken, damaged, or not as described. Being a member for 9 years it's very noticeable how many listings now are just deceptive and dishonest. I recently bought some vacuum cleaner attachments that were listed as fitting the model vacuum cleaner I have, but the item I received is generic and doesn't actually fit my specific vacuum cleaner, despite specifically stating the model in the listing. The item I was sent is actually downright garbage. It legitimately belongs in the trash. It's a product-shaped object rather than a product, just an absolute scam.

Prime fee went up from 7.99 to 9.99 a month, and I wasn't even notified about it. But when I went to cancel my prime membership, they put me through three pages of ""are you sure you want to cancel?"" I am not kidding. After clicking cancel, they directed me to a page that is basically a sales pitch summarizing all the awesome benefits of prime, and gave me three options - remind me three days before membership renewal, proceed with cancellation, or remain a prime member. I clicked proceed with cancellation, and they took me to ANOTHER page where they AGAIN gave me a sales pitch summarizing all the awesome benefits of prime, and offered the SAME three options. I clicked proceed with cancellation, and they took me to a THIRD PAGE with the SAME same sales pitch, and the SAME three options, but this time they were actually arranged differently (possibly to trick me into clicking the wrong one, kind of like the cups and balls trick). So I had to click on the original cancel prime membership link, then I had to go through THREE ""are you sure you REALLY want to cancel?"" pages before they finally let me cancel. I swear, this tactic is intended to make people believe that they have cancelled their membership, when in actuality they didn't. After the first ""are you sure?"", and the second ""are you REALLY sure?"", some people will probably just assume that after they click ""yes, please friggin cancel"" the second time that their membership really is cancelled. But no, they make you do it a THIRD time. It's unbelievable how disrespectful and exploitative this kind of tactic is. I wonder how many people have had incidents where they genuinely believed they cancelled prime, only to find it still being charged to their credit card when they get their credit card statement. It really seems like a deliberate tactic to squeeze out some extra payments from people who aren't paying attention.

Also, Prime Video and Prime Music aren't great. Aside from a few good shows on there most of it is crap that you can get for free on apps like Tubi or other free streaming services. It's really not any kind of incentive to be a prime member in my opinion. Although I did watch all of The Mentalist on Prime, which is a great show.","Amazon Canada was once a great service, but has steadily gone downhill.

"I hear ya. Also in Canada. It’s quite obvious how terrible it has gotten. And how fast it got that way. I’m lucky, I guess, I receive my orders relatively fast. But it’s not like before.

What really pisses me off is the amount of damaged items I’m receiving.  If I’m ordering a gift for someone or if it’s a collectible item…Product boxes are damaged 7/10 times; nevertheless, arriving in immaculate Amazon boxes. Which means they are intentionally shipping these items. What the hell? 

I usually just exchange for the same item…when the replacement arrives it’s in perfect condition with much better packaging!! So they know exactly what they’re putting into the boxes. (It also arrives much faster)

Why are they intentionally shipping out this stuff when they know it’ll be returned, then subsequently make the return process horrible for the customer? 

The assholes who used Amazon as a rental service for years has made it hell for honest consumers. Is this Amazon’s retaliation? They’re only shooting themselves in the foot. 

Daily posts on account banning, people cancelling their membership and Jumping ship to Best Buy and Walmart. I don’t blame them. I think in the US they have Walmart +….no equivalent in Canada yet. I don’t think.

"I’m in the USA but I agree anyway. I still pay for Prime because my entire family uses it (different address) and I do have some niche items I can’t find elsewhere. But overall, Amazon’s service has gone down drastically. I ran into many situations where one day delivery ends up being two or more days. The warehouse near me is known to have bad logistics and lost packages constantly. Customer service is really bad too and also, I ran into so many sketchy third party sellers so I stopped buying third party. For electronics, if it’s less than $100, I’ll buy off Amazon Prime. If more, I take myself to a retail store.

Now I have to pack all this shit and take it to Canada post. In my home country, returning meant 9/10 times Amazon would send a guy to collect and pick up the item. Here, now I gotta pack and label this item and carry it to a Canada post or ups? Fucking third world service in a first world country. I mean I am from third world and I havent had any issues with returns in my own country like wtf.",,k9kw6z0,k06ffw6,1,2023-11-17 01:13:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11jrma2/amazon_canada_was_once_a_great_service_but_has/k9kw6z0
"Terrible customer service since January 2024.  Long time member, suddenly new call centre staff, rude, unhelpful.  A thousand dollars still unrefunded on two undelivered items.  Thechat bot loops cannot address delivery issues.  After ten years and thousands of dollars I am pulling out.  Getting my money back is traumatizing dealing with them.  17 calls on one large item.  .  I have now sent registered mailto Worldwide Operations in Seattle, WA and Bezos. These rude ( fast talkers, hard to understand, but mostly the rudest I have ever spoken to) people they have hired in some foreign country are going to sink this ship.   Next I go to court to find my money.  A homeless group I speak with are mire polite and would live a job…nope given to what seem like Canadian haters..they even hang up in your ear, when you point out wrong delivery dayes, then non delivery on items, etc,  what’s the point.  Costco isdoing a far better job right niw and deliver.",,kpu9d2p,kclqg8s,1,2024-02-10 22:05:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11jrma2/amazon_canada_was_once_a_great_service_but_has/kpu9d2p
"**TLDR:I ordered an phone with a case on the night of September 9th to replace one that just broke earlier that day,so it's important.There has been issues since then and it became undeliveable(and yes, I emailed** [**jeff@amazon.com**](mailto:jeff@amazon.com)**) I didn't trust Amazon enough to reorder it from them,but as time passed my chances of ordering on time from different websites were ruined. I re-order again after the button appears/I was assured that it was fine,the original one package is not coming anymore.Lo and behold hours after the new order was paid and placed,the 'undeliverable not coming you're getting a refund yadda yadda' order arrives!This second phone's  is too showing signs of becoming messy even after it has been cancelled.**

**More detailed info/timeline,skip to the end if you do not need it! thanks :)**

* Ordered device and case with an delivery slot of Overnight 7am to 11am.When I wake up it says at 7:18am the driver couldn't reach me as there was no access to my building and I need to contact the carrier to proceed (which makes no sense since sure, I live in an big apartment with different ,floors but our lobby is unlocked 24/7 and I write instructions...) I use Customer Service through the chat system and the person tells me to type my full address and OTP. I ask what is OTP as this was my first time ever hearing about it.I never bought items of this price,checkout didn't mention anything,and I couldnt access my email at the time since the only way to access my Gmail was to press the 2FA ""yes"" on my phone so yeah.They explain it and switch to the method where I just need the give the driver the last 2 digits of my number.After all of that,they say the package should arrive later today as its  a rush shipping.Ok cool,we end on a pleasant note.
* There were no updates for the next day or two.More chats beforehand just tell me that my order would arrive same day later/OTP comes back as no one brings up the 2 digit method.This is ridiculous as I had to stay home to both give said code and long story short:my job only lets you clock in and out with a mobile app,no exceptions.I start a new chat and just tell the rep that I want to confirm if the items will come today or tomorrow as the driver needs my code.They start apologizing a little too hard and even write ""believe us but it never our intention."" Looking back at it now and for what happens next that was pretty odd.I'm a huge doormat myself and most reps are going to say sorry to make you feel better but I just asked one small question....I thank them and after 4 minutes of silence they write: ""looks like I'll need another team member to help you with this.I'll connect you with them now.""

Umm ok.I tell #2 that I had a problems with my order and she says she'll check my account.Right away I repeat the question I told the 1st person as technically I wasn't finished typing,just wanted to separate my sentences.Guess she won't go back to checking my acc as she right away tells me to contact the carrier.I tell her that's its Amazon so do I contact the carrier facility its in?She says yes then IMMEDIATELY I disconnect due to being inactive for over a minute.Impossible as I was already typing if she knew which facility it was and there have been times where both sides take super long yet nothing happens.I initially believed that it was Amazon being Amazon but as days passed of me facing more bad people and problems, I realized nope she did it on purpose.The first ever CS I spoke didn't mentioned carriers because it's literally you guys! (Edit:Actually, looking at our exchange again,the message came from her own text bubbles and it states the 2nd reason for the disconnect was due to 'me confirming that my issue was solved/for quality reasons' with the system itself saying she left a bit **afterwards**.Regret giving her 5 stars,screw her.So yeah I got two weirdos that barely wrote anything before running away without warning,but with opposite attitudes.)

I looked up carrier facility,there's everything but a phone number.I decide to call CS using someone's phone and after some generic info and apologies,the person puts me on hold as she personally talks to the facility before I get transferred.New person introduces themselves as logistics,says sorry and tells me that he will speak to the drivers,but it should arrive today with a small chance of carrying over tomorrow.Thank him and call ends. Clicking around the site made me realize there's a message center that shows all Amazon related emails and I see that on September 11th at 6am I got an message from [cs-reply@amazon.com](mailto:cs-reply@amazon.com) which states ""Hello,I'm sorry to hear your order hasn't arrived yet.: It looks like your package may have been marked as undeliverable and will be returned to an Amazon Returns Center.If you have not received your package or a refund by September 24 , please contact us back and we can investigate this delivery further."" I kinda trusted this email more than everyone else who just kept saying my order will come same day but why was this status placed only one day after my initial purchase/it's gonna take 2 weeks????? ~~(got access to my Gmail by a few days after this btw)~~

&#x200B;

* Nothing much happened on the 12th,just 2 updates at 7pm about processing at a carrier and whatnot.On September 13th at 4:22 A.M. a delivery was attempted and failed. If the supposed issue the first instance was due to the time as drivers would only knock/contact you from 8am to 8pm,WHY SHIP IT OUT EVEN EARLIER??? (I read in the subreddit that those are flex drivers but this still makes no sense/remember I don't have a phone to pick up anyways) I reach out to CS again and after I explain just a bit,the lady goes ""So you have issues with an order?"" that's vague as hell but whatever I say yes and she transfers me without a word.This new guy is just another CS,not logistics or any higher up and tells me that he will schedule it to be shipped out tomorrow 6am to 8pm.I am in the middle of explaining that I do not want to it arrive in the earlier area of that vague time window but he I kid you not,cuts me off seconds in to simply repeat ""Tomorrow 6 to 8pm."" then ends the call.The tracking page says I rescheduled delivery and that the package will arrive at the agreed time.That last part stings as I was trying to disagree with the time and for good reason.Damn, I get my order is a complicated one but what have I done in my past life for half of these people to be so cold and disconnect after like two words!?After researching everything I can about this, I see the jeff email suggestion and  write to them around midnight about whats been going on along with some unknown monthly charges I've been getting since July.I said I needed a  refund  if I dont get the items soon.
* I am waiting with my account page open at 7am.Then at 8:38am it says the package is undeliverable and will return to sender/wait 2 days for it to arrive to me.So,It finally came after 8am, ~~which Im positive it had nothing to do with the phone call as the guy cut me off,before hearing the important part~~ but despite that still cant reach me?No way this has to do with the OTP anymore and who knows,maybe it wasn't even attempted in the first place.At night I get a reply to my email,it's a bot-like answer repeating what the website told me along with a few extra details like a refund being issued if nothing arrives after the 2 days.The bank charge question and my need for a refund were ignored.
* Between those 2 days, the tracking updates only 3 times around within 2 hours saying the package returned to seller,arrived at a carrier facility,and is being processed at said facility.I always thought the whole Undeliverable message was weird since how can something be both claimed as not being able to come to me anymore yet also will also arrive to my place in 2 days? I get later on discovering that it can it be turned deliverable again when whatever the hell happened gets solved but that should be stated IF and AFTER,this sounds like more 'say what the customer wants to hear' lies to me....
* Next day the package now says Problem Occurred,they cant deliver my item and I should get a refund in 3-5 days.Not surprised and I call CS to confirm and ask if I am safe to order again as I mentioned at the top,this waiting game made the status from other sites saying that the phone I want would ship in days to now long weeks to even months.I reordered the 2nd phone and case,this time it mentions OTP/a signature at checkout.Arriving today 5pm to 10pm while the case comes Tuesday,my choice to wait an extra day.I get a knock hours later. It is an Amazon driver holding a package and asking for OTP.I understood asap that this was the 1st phone from a week ago,the undeliverable one and I am just dumbfounded at this company!The new phone tracking update is traveling through time as around 3pm it says the carrier is processing 4 hours into the future,7pm then says 5pm when well,5pm comes and there's an update (looking back I got these bugs days ago too) by 8:30ish  the phone is now considered arriving late and will be expected by 8am the next day.
* At this point I want both orders taken back and refunded,I am absolutely over it.The 2nd phone-case is the only thing with a cancel button so regardless I have to speak to someone.CS chat it is.I barely got to say much and the first person claims that they'll get someone from a so called different department aka 'Yeah Im not gonna bother,lemme throw you to another CS!!' New person tells me ""It looks like your package may have been marked as undeliverable and will be returned to an Amazon Returns Center.If you have not received your package or a refund by September 30, 2023  please contact us back and we can investigate this delivery further.""  I reply that yeah that was the deal with first one... it's here somehow sooo,let's return and refund it,but I was talking to you about today's phone/the case arriving in 2 days, cancel those.They ask if I want to return the one I have and I say yep also reminding them that its specifically the wacky undelivereable order and to cancel the one on its way.All they say is that I can return after the 17th.I bring up that *it is* the 17th in  and ask if there will be a return button that'll eventually appear as its still saying its undeliverable aka I have no options.Then they say ""As the shipment has received undeliverable scan you we cannot take any action until September 17, 2023"" righttttt.It's before 5am so you kinda got me there but again,it's still the 17th. CS: ""Request to please wait until September 17, 2023 end of the day"" Ok then.I ask about the 2nd one and they tell me to just let it ship and then return it as they cant do anything.Whatever,let's just hope this loop doesn't repeat.
* Around 8am,still nothing with the new phone and the cancelled case goes back to saying Arriving Tuesday.Shitty order that I have now says 'On the Way Back Your refund will be issued soon' with only two buttons,to check the refund/return status and to write a review.When clicking the one I care about, both items just say return requested in green font with the page showing nothing else but the continue shopping button far to the right.I call someone about this and they have no info about being able to return these...

**So- how do I go about this?Im worried that the upcoming phone isnt truly being taken back at the moment and will repeat the cycle.This especially sucks as I can't keep dealing with OTP codes and waiting at home.The chat-box is horrible and were the biggest liars.Phone calls are slightly better but still useless,and the jeff email was too bot-like and ignored half of my concerns.I have been lied to,shut down,and not compensated at all.I did not post photos as there are too many and Im a newbie to Reddit posting but I indeed took screenshots of everything for proof if anyone requires certain ones\~ We are never ones to contact Amazon if orders were 1 or 2 days late yet they keep happening this year and replacements are commonplace now as the last items have been all labeled as handed to us when it wasn't true.** (We even had one say that it was signed by a name who didn't belong to anyone in our building office!A driver gave us the OG order 1 day after the replacement arrived!) **I understand human errors and accidents** **but this is pure madness of no one knowing anything about one order. Online research isn't giving me answers so I'd like to know if anyone had this experience?Ive seen the links for BBB,FTC and** [**consumer.gov**](https://consumer.gov) **in this subreddit but I'm not sure about bothering these groups yet if the issue isn't a colossal emergency.I'm** **reading up on them but any personal details about how they operate would be very appreciated...there also have been comments about asking for Bank charge-backs?After getting some help I guess I'll see to that first as I don't want Amazon keeping my money when they realize they don't have anything to return back to the respective sellers despite me begging to them that I have the items on me and want a return label!!!   Thank you so much for reading,sorry for the length\~**

* Edit Update as of 9/24!: Nothing changed for the joint package in my house.The reordered one says refund issued and the money should go back to my card in 2-4days.The case came normally.Opened CS chat and the guy went to check,popping up 4 times to apologize to say that he was still checking (in a span of only 5 minutes mind you) then moved me to someone else.This new person copy-pastes the ""undeliverable,refund by the 24th yadda yadda"" message and when I said that I HAVE THE PHONE,she went 'oh.ok you can return by October 11th', and went to see if I can get a label.She came back and said 'I can't ,so you can keep or dispose of the item' ???This is usually said to replacement orders where you end up having 2 items,she cant be telling me that I can keep this AND get a refund?I ask about said refund and she goes Of course you're not getting a refund.I tell her that yeah,I wasnt expecting a free phone: it's an expensive item,from a 3rd party seller,and I dont feel comfy with the thought in general,especially since I feel like a ""You need to give us back your item"" email can come anytime soon...She tells me thanks for understanding and disconnects without a proper goodbye. I am in the middle of writing  another email to jeff@amazon.com at this time since these last two weeks have been BS!This is Amazon,not some all Sales Final walk in shop!I would need a return option regardless like any other product if the phone ends up having issues too ><","Help with an order that is ""undeliverable"" but came after I didnt need it",16ozgff,0,1,2023-09-22 04:08:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/16ozgff/help_with_an_order_that_is_undeliverable_but_came/
