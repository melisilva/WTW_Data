I haven't been kicked out again but tomorrow between the nightly news and local news will be the test. 

Clearing the roku cache

On the remote: 
Press home once

Then quickly: 

Press the ""Home"" button five times. ...
Press the ""UP"" button once.
Press the ""Rewind"" button 2 times. ...
Press the ""Fast Forward"" button 2 times.
Wait 10-20 seconds and your Roku device will be restarted.

"So, for a couple months I wasn't paying for but 1 cheap streaming service. Some, if you are gone a couple months, will let you have ""the specials"", so I load up over the space of about 6 weeks. Hadn't had Netflix for a long long time, got the cheapest with ads. Starz, why? got it cheap, dropping because why charge for that faultry amount of outdated B quality stuff. Got huly back on the cheap, probably keep it a bit. Paramount, rewatched Y, not gonna keep it, really sick of the blatant over manipulations with the Peacock/Paramount shit, and wonder if that big clock is ticking down on meglamania Taylor Sheridan. Got a weird one, MHZ choice, full of foreign language TV, SOOOOOOOO many formula detective series, man/woman  damaged/brilliant  friction/friendship or romance, and now I KNOW popular all over the world. Beautiful scenes, sweden France, on and on. Not expensive, and interesting to check out, on the fence as to whether I will keep it. Thinking about getting Criterion channel back, but NOT through roku, hulu, etc, because I learned that if you get it directly from Criterion, you can pause it for a month or two if you like, which is a fantastic idea for streamers to do, HOPE IT CATCHES ON, because the movement has started, WE WILL DROP THE STREAMERS, they will always take you back, sometimes at a discount.....................",,kcg4pyj,k5wrmnb,1,2023-12-08 02:14:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/14fknyx/hulu_keeps_kicking_me_out/kcg4pyj

"Got an intermittent problem that's super annoying with Hulu Live.  

I've got 4 Apple TVS (3 are the 4k model from a couple of years ago) and on all of them when changing channels watching Live TV, sometimes there's no audio for about 10-15 seconds, then the screen will act like it's refreshing content on the screen and the audio will work.  The screen refresh I'm describing is similar to when you're watching a live show and another show comes on, the screen blips and you see the bar at the bottom of the screen briefly...at that point the audio comes back.  

It doesn't seem to happen to all channels...happens to me on the weather channel, science channel, sometimes cooking channel among others...it's intermittent.

Oh. Then it’s definitely a bug.,,jpjfjaq,jpjfc0n,3,2023-06-26 02:59:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/14j3cr0/ads_even_on_adfree_plan/jpjfjaq
Not a bug. Just Hulu being money grabbing bastards. It’s why I cancelled. Even with VOD…that is still streaming; it is not live tv. They’ve changed the rules and are pushing more ads to drive up revenue. I hope more people say enough is enough and cancel this crap.,,k5voz5j,jpjfjaq,0,2023-10-21 21:41:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/14j3cr0/ads_even_on_adfree_plan/k5voz5j
They haven’t changed the rules. I haven’t seen an ad on Hulu outside Grey’s Anatomy for years.,,k5ys9x1,k5voz5j,1,2023-10-22 14:55:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/14j3cr0/ads_even_on_adfree_plan/k5ys9x1
,why is the add to tv show ratio so bad it starts you out with a couple mins of ads just to start the new episode but then 11 mins in i got 5 mins of ads? i have already memorized all the ads,11qwu1r,0,4,2023-03-14 04:44:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/
They obviously make at least slightly more with the ad-free option so they are pushing people to it.  That is the only answer that makes sense.,,jc6t6jw,11qwu1r,2,2023-03-14 13:50:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc6t6jw
"I’m over the ads, too. I pay annually, so when it’s time to renew I’m going ad free.",,jc5k2c4,11qwu1r,1,2023-03-14 04:54:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc5k2c4
"And remember, the ad free version of Hulu+ Live TV still has ads. Only the content in the comparatively small Hulu library is ad free.",,jc7673h,jc6t6jw,2,2023-03-14 15:21:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc7673h
ads are making me lose my mind. most days i wish i was born just about any time into history😂😭 and paying more to get rid of ads seems like thats what they want you to do :/ it is all just some way to get you to spend more,,jc5kr2m,jc5k2c4,2,2023-03-14 05:01:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc5kr2m
The ads on Live are not near as badly obnoxious as on their on-demand service though.  Most of the ads are inserted by the channels so Hulu has less time to annoy us with the same 3 ads over and over.,,jc77oqh,jc7673h,0,2023-03-14 15:31:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc77oqh
That’s true. When it really starts bugging me I stay off Hulu for a few days and stick to services I have that are ad free.,,jc5kwyx,jc5kr2m,1,2023-03-14 05:03:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc5kwyx
"Agree that they're not quite as long but they are targeted meaning I get the same ads over and over again. At least it varies day to day. 

My comment was to remind people that Hulu+ Live has ads for content that Hulu licences and doesn't own. That the vast majority of what's available on demand.",,jc78u66,jc77oqh,1,2023-03-14 15:39:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11qwu1r/why_is_the_add_to_tv_show_ratio_so_bad_it_starts/jc78u66

"I'm guessing Hulu is doing this because they've run out of things to suggest for me, but recently a bunch of shows I know I've disliked have started appearing again in my suggested feed with the dislikes removed.

"I think it’s just one of the several bugs Hulu has, for instance my shows keep coming back to my up next feed with all of them set to S1 E1 as if I’ve never watched them yet.  Shows also stay on my feed at times even when I set them to remove from my watch history, it’s all very frustrating",,ja6lwf9,11d2j42,11,2023-02-27 05:41:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hulu/comments/11d2j42/anyone_notice_hulu_removing_dislikes_from_shows/ja6lwf9
