What exact steps did you take that customer support actually helped you? I’ve had a ticket elevated for review for a month. I’ve had ads in all content since starting the account at the end of November. We respond to the emails they send and then a few days later they just ask the same questions with no actual proposed resolution. No idea how to go about getting it fixed.,,kog506h,19e5109,1,2024-02-01 15:48:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacock/comments/19e5109/ads_with_premium_plus/kog506h

Yes!! The amount of ads are infuriating. If it's still like that I would definitely chat with customer service and hopefully that will solve it!

Ugh that's super annoying! My ads are finally gone. I had to chat with 2 customer service agents and they just had me log in/out & reboot my Roku 173829 times lol. They ended up having to escalate it and I got an email saying they'd look into it. Ads randomly went away the next day though so not sure if customer service fixed it or if it was like a sitewide glitch?

"It took me TWO DAYS to figure this out and get it resolved, and I'm hoping to save Comcast / Xfinity customers a lot of headaches. 

When Comcast downgraded the free Peacock Premium perk for Xfinity customers, it left some customers who had the Plus add-on in a kind of Peacock limbo — since Monday, those customers haven't been able to use their Plus add-on or activate a promotional deal (mostly the Gigabit promo for free Peacock Premium, but also the $3 a month promo for other subscribers), because of a ""bug"" on Comcast's end.

The ""bug"" seems to involve how Plus renewed itself independent of the free Peacock Premium that was offered prior to Monday. When Comcast downgraded everyone's subscription, they *didn't take into account customers who paid for Plus*, and that ""broke"" various subscription processing protocols that exist between Peacock and Comcast's system.

After spending HOURS online and on chat with various Peacock and Comcast reps, I was finally able to resolve the issue. In retrospect, this seems obvious, but I didn't try it until tonight, and it worked. Here's what you need to do:

**First, you need to cancel your Plus subscription, which requires contacting Peacock customer support. You can do this over chat:**

1. Sign in to your Peacock account on the Peacock website.
2. Next, visit Peacock's customer support page [here](https://www.peacocktv.com/help/article/contact-us-in-customer-service), and click or tap ""Get in Touch"" in the second paragraph.
3. Under ""Pick a Category,"" choose the tile that says ""Plans and Payment""
4. On the next page, choose ""Cancel Plan""
5. On the ""Cancel Plan"" page, scroll all the way down to the bottom until you see ""Still need help?"" then click the link that says ""Chat with us"" in the ""Live Chat"" tile. (*Live chat is only available between 9 a.m. and 1 a.m. Eastern Time*)
6. A pop-up chat box will appear in the corner of your window, and you'll be put in a ""queue."" This tends to go by fast, usually about 5 to 10 minutes.
7. Once you're connected with an agent, explain to them that you're having problems activating your new Peacock Premium promotion because you have Plus. Ask them to immediately cancel and refund your Plus payment.
8. The CSR might give you steps to activate Peacock Premium. Politely let them know you've tried everything, and you want to cancel Plus and receive a refund. 
9. When the CSR pushes through your cancellation and refund request, thank them, then close out the window.

**Next, you need to wait 15-30 minutes for things to refresh between Comcast and Peacock. When that does, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the Xfinity website and log in with your username and password.
2. Next, head to the Xfinity Assitant virtual chat by clicking or [tapping here](https://www.xfinity.com/assistant). 
3. When the Xfinity Assitant loads, you should see a tile that says ""Activate your Peacock Premium subscription,"" or something to that effect. Click the link that says ""Activate.""
4. When the Peacock website opens, enter the email address you used with your Peacock Premium subscription prior to Monday (it may be the same as your Xfinity account e-mail, but it might also be different, depending on how you signed up).
5. Follow the steps to activate the promotion. If you're eligible for the free Peacock Premium subscription because you have Gigabit Internet or higher, you won't be asked to enter billing information, and you won't be charged. If you are eligible for the $3 a month promo, you'll be asked to enter your credit card number or link your PayPal account to your subscription.

I have no idea why the process is so involved — it seems Comcast could have made this whole experience *much easier*, but the above are literally the steps I had to take to redeem the Gigabit offer for Peacock Premium, and I hope it helps the many of you who, like me, have been stuck in Peacock purgatory since Monday.

"Just FYI: For those who previously had the Plus add-on, there's currently no way to add Plus on your account when you take advantage of the new Peacock Premium promos. This is likely due to a bug on Comcast's end; an option to add-on Plus is supposed to come later.

2. Wait a while, 10-60 minutes.
3. Go to https://www.xfinity.com/xfinityassistant/ and if it is done processing there will be an activate Peacock button. Click it. Takes you to Peacock and you enter your existing account email.
4. If that didn't work go to https://www.xfinity.com/auth and click the activate Peacock there.

"Peacock is the only service where I feel that the ad-supported version is the way to go.  Watching a movie, there are 3 minutes of ads at the beginning.  That's it.  During a half hour show, you get three to four 30-60 second ads throughout.  It's so much better than other streamers.  Hulu, for example, is absolutely unbearable.  It feels like you get more ads than actual content.  I don't feel the need to pay double for Peacock with ads.  With Hulu, even though I get the ad-supported tier free with my phone plan (in a bundle with Disney+ & ESPN+), I don't watch it. I don't have that kind of patience.  I've been thinking of subscribing to the ad-free tier, but $18 a month is too much.  I'm waiting to see what it'll cost for Hulu/Disney+ when the merger is finalized in March. As for Peacock Premium Plus, the ads are almost non-existent.  I just don't feel that paying double the price is necessary when the ads on the regular premium plan aren't that intrusive. (Especially when compared to any other streamer.) Max is the only other one I've tried that isn't completely unwatchable with ads, but with everything they've taken off of their service, I won't subscribe again until The Last Of US S2 comes on.",,khb041p,18g9mzv,1,2024-01-11 02:27:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacock/comments/18g9mzv/how_many_ads_is_typical_for_premium_plus/khb041p
"Only on live tv? Are you a premium plus subscriber and can confirm? Just curious. 

In my account settings it says I have premium plus, and my bank account does too. I’ve contacted peacock to see what’s the issue but no help as of yet.",,kczf15s,kczce2d,-1,2023-12-12 02:20:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacock/comments/18g9mzv/how_many_ads_is_typical_for_premium_plus/kczf15s

"You should not be receiving ads with premium plus, except for a few live TV shows.  Something must be messed up with your account.  Are you 100% sure you're logging in with the correct e-mail address on the device (the account that has the premium plus plan - some people have free plans that are logged in and then sign up a new account with premium plus with a different e-mail).  Otherwise, perhaps try removing the premium plus and adding it back on if you can't get any resolution from support.",,kczwu6k,kczf15s,3,2023-12-12 04:26:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacock/comments/18g9mzv/how_many_ads_is_typical_for_premium_plus/kczwu6k
